"""
Sub-Agent C: Confidence Gate Agent

Authors: Syed Ali Turab, Fergie Feng & Diana Liu | Team: Broadview
Date:   March 1, 2026

Validates required intake fields, assesses overall data confidence,
detects conflicting signals, and determines the next action.

This agent acts as a quality checkpoint between intake and triage.
It ensures the data is complete and coherent enough to produce a
reliable triage classification. If not, it either:
  - Requests clarification (loop back to Intake, up to 2 times)
  - Routes to a human receptionist (conflicting signals or max loops)

Confidence scoring formula:
  - Start at 1.0 (fully confident)
  - Subtract 0.3 for each missing REQUIRED field
  - Subtract 0.1 for each missing IMPORTANT field
  - Subtract 0.2 for each detected conflict
  - Clamp to [0.0, 1.0]

Action thresholds:
  - confidence >= 0.6 AND no conflicts → 'proceed' to triage
  - confidence < 0.6 OR missing required → 'clarify' (loop to Intake)
  - conflicts detected → 'human_review' (route to receptionist)

Input:  Structured intake data from the Intake Agent
Output: Confidence score, missing fields, conflicts, recommended action

    Field validation and confidence assessment agent.

    Checks three dimensions of data quality:
      1. Completeness: Are all required and important fields present?
      2. Coherence: Are there any conflicting signals in the data?
      3. Sufficiency: Is there enough detail for accurate triage?

    Based on the assessment, recommends one of three actions:
      - 'proceed': Data is good enough for triage
      - 'clarify': Need more information (loop to Intake)
      - 'human_review': Data is conflicting (route to receptionist)
