Sub-Agent A: Intake Agent

Author: Syed Ali Turab
Date:   March 1, 2026

Collects pet profile, chief complaint, and symptom details through
adaptive, multi-turn follow-up questions tailored to species and symptom area.

This agent is the first in the pipeline and handles the conversational
intake flow. It:
  1. Parses the owner's free-text message for pet profile fields
     (species, breed, age, weight, name)
  2. Identifies the symptom area (GI, respiratory, derm, injury, urinary, etc.)
  3. Asks adaptive follow-up questions specific to the symptom area
  4. Builds a structured output that downstream agents can consume

The intake process is multi-turn: the agent may need 2-5 messages to
collect all required information. The Orchestrator manages the turn loop.

Input:  Owner's free-text message + current session state
Output: Structured pet_profile + symptom_details + follow-up questions

# When the intake agent identifies a symptom area, it selects the
# appropriate set of follow-up questions. These are designed to collect
# the minimum information needed for accurate triage.
#
# Each area's questions target the key differentiating factors that
# determine urgency (e.g., blood in vomit → higher urgency for GI).

class IntakeAgent:

    Adaptive symptom intake agent.

    Conducts a structured, multi-turn conversation to collect:
      - Pet profile (species, breed, age, weight, name)
      - Chief complaint (primary symptom description)
      - Symptom details (area-specific information)
      - Timeline (when symptoms started, progression)
      - Context (eating/drinking, energy level, possible triggers)

    The agent adapts its follow-up questions based on:
      - Species (dogs vs cats vs exotic have different common conditions)
      - Symptom area (GI vs respiratory vs injury need different details)
      - What information has already been collected
