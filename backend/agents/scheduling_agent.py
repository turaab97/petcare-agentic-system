Sub-Agent F: Scheduling Agent

Authors: Syed Ali Turab, Fergie Feng & Diana Liu | Team: Broadview
Date:   March 1, 2026

Proposes available appointment slots based on urgency tier,
appointment type, and provider pool. Uses mock schedule data for POC.

The scheduling agent matches the triage urgency and routing result
against the clinic's available time slots:
  - Emergency → no booking (direct to ER); returns not_applicable
  - Same-day  → filter for today's remaining slots
  - Soon      → filter for next 1-3 days
  - Routine   → any available slot in the next 7 days

Returns the top 2-3 matching slots for the owner to choose from.
If no matching slots exist, generates a manual booking request
payload that can be sent to clinic staff.

For the POC, schedule data comes from backend/data/available_slots.json.
In production, this would integrate with a real clinic scheduling API
(e.g., via REST/FHIR interface).

Input:  Routing result (appointment type + providers) + triage result (urgency)
Output: Proposed slots array or booking request payload
