Sub-Agent D: Triage Agent

Authors: Syed Ali Turab, Fergie Feng & Diana Liu | Team: Broadview
Date:   March 1, 2026

Classifies urgency into four tiers based on validated symptom data,
with evidence-based rationale and confidence scoring.

Urgency Tiers:
  - Emergency:  Life-threatening, needs immediate care (go to ER NOW)
  - Same-day:   Significant concern, should be seen today
  - Soon:       Non-urgent but needs attention within 1-3 days
  - Routine:    Standard wellness or minor concern, schedule at convenience

The triage decision considers:
  - Symptom severity and type
  - Timeline (how long symptoms have persisted)
  - Eating/drinking status (reduced = more urgent)
  - Energy level (lethargic = more urgent)
  - Species-specific norms (e.g., cats hide symptoms → often more urgent
    by the time owners notice)
  - Number and combination of symptoms

Conservative by design: when borderline, the agent assigns the
HIGHER urgency tier. Under-triage is more dangerous than over-triage.

Input:  Validated intake data + safety gate result
Output: Urgency tier + rationale + confidence + contributing factors

    Urgency classification agent.

    Assigns one of four urgency tiers to each intake case based on
    the validated symptom data. Provides an evidence-based rationale
    and a confidence score.

    The current implementation uses a rule-based heuristic that counts
    high-urgency vs low-urgency signals. The production version will
    use an LLM with structured output for more nuanced classification.

    Conservative default: when uncertain, assigns higher urgency.
    This is a deliberate design choice — it's safer to over-triage
    than to under-triage a potentially serious condition.

        Classify urgency tier based on intake data and safety check.

        Uses a signal-counting heuristic as a rule-based fallback:
          - Count high-urgency signals in the complaint text
          - Count low-urgency signals
          - Adjust based on eating/drinking and energy levels
          - Apply species-specific modifiers (cats get +1 urgency bump)
          - Map the final score to a tier

            intake_data: Dict from the Intake Agent with chief_complaint,

            safety_result: Dict from the Safety Gate Agent (used to check
