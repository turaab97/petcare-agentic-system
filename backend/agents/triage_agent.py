Sub-Agent D: Triage Agent

Authors: Syed Ali Turab, Fergie Feng & Diana Liu | Team: Broadview
Date:   March 1, 2026
Code updated: Syed Ali Turab, March 4, 2026 — LLM triage with rule-based fallback.

Classifies urgency into four tiers based on validated symptom data,
with evidence-based rationale and confidence scoring.

Urgency Tiers:
  - Emergency:  Life-threatening, needs immediate care (go to ER NOW)
  - Same-day:   Significant concern, should be seen today
  - Soon:       Non-urgent but needs attention within 1-3 days
  - Routine:    Standard wellness or minor concern, schedule at convenience

The triage decision considers:
  - Symptom severity and type
  - Timeline (how long symptoms have persisted)
  - Eating/drinking status (reduced = more urgent)
  - Energy level (lethargic = more urgent)
  - Species-specific norms (e.g., cats hide symptoms → often more urgent
    by the time owners notice)
  - Number and combination of symptoms

Conservative by design: when borderline, the agent assigns the
HIGHER urgency tier. Under-triage is more dangerous than over-triage.

Input:  Validated intake data + safety gate result
Output: Urgency tier + rationale + confidence + contributing factors

    high-urgency vs low-urgency signals. The production version will

    Conservative default: when uncertain, assigns higher urgency.

3. The rationale field is read ONLY by clinic staff — use clinical observation language but NO diagnosis names
