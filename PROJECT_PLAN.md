# PetCare Triage & Smart Booking Agent -- Project Plan

**Authors:** Syed Ali Turab, Fergie Feng & Diana Liu | **Team:** Broadview
**Date:** March 6, 2026

**Due date:** March 22, 2026 · **Target build complete:** March 10–11, 2026 · **Current status:** Build complete, report in progress

## Overview

This project plan outlines the development of the PetCare Triage & Smart Booking Agent, a multi-agent POC for the MMAI 891 Final Project. The system automates pet symptom intake, triage urgency classification, appointment routing, and provides safe owner guidance through an orchestrator-coordinated sub-agent architecture.

## Phase 4: Webhook Automation -- Actions Layer (Week 6)

**Goal:** Add post-intake webhook automation so the system can fire downstream actions (Slack, email, etc.) after the agent pipeline completes.

### Architecture

```
PetCare Agent Pipeline → Intake Complete → POST to webhook URL (if configured) → Downstream actions
```

The backend sends a JSON payload to a configurable webhook URL. The webhook receiver (n8n, Slack, Zapier, custom endpoint) handles everything after that.

### Implementation Tasks

| Task | Owner | Status | Priority |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| Add webhook POST to `api_server.py` (non-blocking) | -- | Done | P0 |
| Guard webhook behind `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` env var | -- | Done | P0 |
| Test webhook fires on intake_complete and emergency events | -- | Done | P0 |
| Document webhook setup in DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md | -- | Done | P1 |

### POC Status

Webhook code is **implemented and optional**. The app runs fully without any webhook configured. For production, the webhook layer would be expanded to support multiple event types and receivers.

### Deliverables
- [x] Webhook integration implemented in PetCare backend
- [x] Fires only if `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` is set (optional for POC)

---

## Phase 5: Evaluation & Testing (Week 7)

**Goal:** Evaluate against success metrics using the synthetic test set.

| Task | Owner | Status | Priority |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| Prepare final test set (20+ scenarios) | -- | Done (6 scenarios; expand post-POC) | P0 |
| Evaluate triage tier agreement (target ≥ 80%) | -- | Done (100% — 6/6) | P0 |
| Evaluate routing accuracy (target ≥ 80%) | -- | TBD | P0 |
| Evaluate intake completeness (target ≥ 90%) | -- | Done (100% — 5/6, scenario 1 emergency path) | P0 |
| Document strong example + failure case | -- | Done (in technical_report.md) | P0 |
| Measure latency per intake session | -- | Done (~11.4s avg) | P1 |

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Under-triage (serious case labeled routine) | High | Medium | Conservative red-flag rules + mandatory escalation messaging |
| Over-triage (too many cases flagged urgent) | Medium | Medium | Calibrate thresholds using scenario tests; allow receptionist override |
| Bad routing (wrong appointment type) | Medium | Medium | Maintain clinic-owned routing map + version control |
| LLM hallucination in guidance | High | Low | Strict non-diagnostic language constraints; rule-based safety gate |
| API latency exceeds 15s target | Medium | Medium | Limit model calls via routing; cache clinic rules |
| Incomplete intake (owner abandons flow) | Medium | High | Keep intake concise; show progress; allow partial submission |

---

## Key Decisions Log

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| 7-sub-agent + orchestrator architecture | Matches canvas design; enables modular testing and clear safety boundaries | -- |
| Custom orchestrator (no framework for POC) | Simplicity and robustness; assignment values "fewest steps." LangGraph optional post-POC for explicit graph; Google ADK not used (Vertex-centric, off our stack). | -- |
| Session-only memory (no persistent PII) | Privacy-by-design; no need for cross-session data in POC | -- |
| Synthetic data for all testing | No real PHI needed; enables rapid iteration and shareable test sets | -- |
| Flask backend + vanilla JS frontend | Lightweight, fast to develop, consistent with MMAI 891 project patterns | -- |
| Webhook automation (optional actions layer) | Configurable webhook POST; handles post-intake actions without coupling to agent logic. n8n, Slack, Zapier, or custom endpoint. Optional for POC. | -- |
| Docker single-container deployment | Single Dockerfile for petcare-agent; deployed on Render | -- |
| Conservative triage defaults | Safety-first: when uncertain, escalate rather than under-triage | -- |
| Warm teal PetCare theme | Professional veterinary branding; distinct from generic blue tech products | March 6, 2026 |
| Consumer-ready features (Phase 6) | Streaming, PWA, feedback, reminders — makes the POC feel like a real product | March 6, 2026 |
