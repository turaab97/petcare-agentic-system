# PetCare Triage & Smart Booking Agent -- Project Plan

**Authors:** Syed Ali Turab & Fergie Feng | **Team:** Broadview
**Date:** March 1, 2026

**Due date:** March 22, 2026 · **Target build complete:** March 10–11, 2026

## Overview

This project plan outlines the development of the PetCare Triage & Smart Booking Agent, a multi-agent POC for the MMAI 891 Final Project. The system automates pet symptom intake, triage urgency classification, appointment routing, and provides safe owner guidance through an orchestrator-coordinated sub-agent architecture.

## Phase 4: n8n Workflow Automation -- Actions Layer (Week 6)

**Goal:** Add real-world automated actions that fire after the agent pipeline completes. This turns the POC from "chat interface" into "system that does things."

### Why n8n?

n8n is an open-source workflow automation platform (self-hostable via Docker, or free cloud tier). It receives webhook events from the PetCare backend and triggers downstream actions -- email, Slack, Google Sheets, etc. -- with zero code changes to the agent logic.

### Architecture

```
PetCare Agent Pipeline → Intake Complete → POST webhook to n8n → n8n Workflows
```

The backend sends a JSON payload to an n8n webhook at key events. n8n handles everything after that.

### n8n Workflows to Build

| # | Workflow | Trigger Event | Actions | Priority |
|---|----------|--------------|---------|----------|
| 1 | **Emergency Alert** | Safety Gate detects red flag | → Slack message to #emergency channel → Email on-call vet with pet profile + symptoms | P0 |
| 2 | **Clinic Summary Delivery** | Intake session completes | → Format structured summary → Email to clinic inbox → Append row to Google Sheet (intake log) | P0 |
| 3 | **Appointment Confirmation** | Scheduling Agent proposes slot | → Email pet owner with appointment details → Add event to Google Calendar (mock) | P1 |
| 4 | **Intake Analytics Logger** | Every completed session | → Log session data to Google Sheet (triage tier, confidence, latency, language used) → Use for evaluation metrics | P1 |
| 5 | **Follow-Up Reminder** | 24 hours after routine triage | → Email pet owner with follow-up guidance → Link to re-start intake if symptoms worsen | P2 |

### Implementation Tasks

| Task | Owner | Status | Priority |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| Set up n8n (Docker container or n8n Cloud free tier) | -- | Not Started | P0 |
| Create `docker-compose.yml` for petcare + n8n multi-container | -- | Not Started | P0 |
| Add webhook trigger endpoints to `api_server.py` | -- | Not Started | P0 |

| Test full end-to-end: intake → agents → n8n → actions | -- | Not Started | P0 |
| Document n8n setup in DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md | -- | Not Started | P1 |

### n8n Deployment Options

| **Self-hosted (Docker)** | $0 | 15 minutes | Full control, runs alongside petcare-agent |
| **Self-hosted (docker-compose)** | $0 | 15 minutes | One-command setup for both services |

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Under-triage (serious case labeled routine) | High | Medium | Conservative red-flag rules + mandatory escalation messaging |
| Over-triage (too many cases flagged urgent) | Medium | Medium | Calibrate thresholds using scenario tests; allow receptionist override |
| Bad routing (wrong appointment type) | Medium | Medium | Maintain clinic-owned routing map + version control |
| LLM hallucination in guidance | High | Low | Strict non-diagnostic language constraints; rule-based safety gate |
| API latency exceeds 15s target | Medium | Medium | Limit model calls via routing; cache clinic rules |
| Incomplete intake (owner abandons flow) | Medium | High | Keep intake concise; show progress; allow partial submission |

---

## Key Decisions Log

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| 7-sub-agent + orchestrator architecture | Matches canvas design; enables modular testing and clear safety boundaries | -- |
| Custom orchestrator (no framework for POC) | Simplicity and robustness; assignment values "fewest steps." LangGraph optional post-POC for explicit graph; Google ADK not used (Vertex-centric, off our stack). | -- |
| Session-only memory (no persistent PII) | Privacy-by-design; no need for cross-session data in POC | -- |
| Synthetic data for all testing | No real PHI needed; enables rapid iteration and shareable test sets | -- |
| Flask backend + vanilla JS frontend | Lightweight, fast to develop, consistent with MMAI 891 project patterns | -- |
| n8n for workflow automation (actions layer) | Open-source, self-hostable, zero-code workflow builder; handles post-intake actions (email, Slack, Sheets) without coupling to agent logic | -- |
| docker-compose for multi-container setup | Runs petcare-agent + n8n side-by-side; one-command startup | -- |
| Conservative triage defaults | Safety-first: when uncertain, escalate rather than under-triage | -- |
