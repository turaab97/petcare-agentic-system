# PetCare Triage & Smart Booking Agent -- Technical Report

**Authors:** Syed Ali Turab, Fergie Feng & Diana Liu | **Team:** Broadview
**Date:** March 6, 2026

## Executive Summary

The PetCare Triage & Smart Booking Agent is a multi-agent proof-of-concept designed to reduce veterinary clinic front-desk workload and improve clinical routing accuracy. The system automates the pet symptom intake process through an AI-powered conversational interface, classifies urgency into four tiers (Emergency / Same-day / Soon / Routine), routes cases to the appropriate appointment type and provider pool, and generates both owner-facing guidance and a structured clinic-ready intake summary.

**Problem:** Veterinary clinic receptionists spend an average of 5 minutes per intake call asking ad-hoc symptom questions and manually determining urgency and appointment type. During peak hours, this creates queues, inconsistent triage quality, and mis-routing that leads to rescheduling and delays.

**Solution:** An orchestrator-coordinated multi-agent system that provides structured, safe, and explainable triage support -- reducing intake time while improving routing accuracy and consistency.

**Key Results:** The agent achieved 100% triage accuracy and 100% red flag detection across 6 synthetic test scenarios (English, French, and ambiguous multi-turn), with an average end-to-end processing time of 11,378ms versus an estimated 5-minute manual baseline intake call.

## 1. Problem Definition

### 1.1 Who Is This For?

| User | Role | Pain Point |
|------|------|------------|
| **Clinic receptionist / intake staff** (primary) | Operational user | High call volume, inconsistent triage, manual routing |
| **Pet owners** (secondary) | Self-serve intake + scheduling | Long hold times, unclear next steps, anxiety |
| **Veterinarians / vet techs** (downstream) | Receive structured intake summary | Incomplete handoff notes, unstructured information |

### 1.2 What Is Hard Today?

- Owners call the clinic; reception staff ask ad-hoc questions, interpret urgency, choose an appointment slot, and manually explain next steps
- Intake quality varies by staff experience
- Peak-time calls create queues
- Mis-routing (wrong appointment type/doctor/urgency) leads to rescheduling and delays

### 1.3 How Often Does It Happen?

Example clinic: 30 calls/day x 5 min intake = 150 min/day spent on intake alone.

### 1.4 What Would "Better" Look Like?

- Consistent, structured intake regardless of who (or what) handles it
- Automatic red-flag detection that never misses an emergency
- Correct routing on first attempt (fewer re-bookings)
- Pet owners receive clear next steps and safe waiting guidance
- Vets get structured pre-visit summaries

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Architecture Overview

The system uses a **7-sub-agent architecture** coordinated by a central **Orchestrator Agent**. Each sub-agent has a single responsibility and communicates via structured JSON.

```
Owner Input (symptoms, pet info)
        |
        v
+--------------------+
| A. Intake Agent    |  Collect pet profile + chief complaint + follow-ups
+--------------------+
        |
        v
+--------------------+
| B. Safety Gate     |  Detect emergency red flags
+--------------------+
        |
   [Red flag?] --Yes--> EMERGENCY ESCALATION (stop booking)
        | No
        v
+--------------------+
| C. Confidence Gate |  Verify completeness + confidence
+--------------------+
        |
   [Low confidence?] --Yes--> Ask clarifying questions (loop to Intake)
        | OK                   or route to receptionist
        v
+--------------------+
| D. Triage Agent    |  Assign urgency tier + rationale
+--------------------+
        |
        v
+--------------------+
| E. Routing Agent   |  Map symptoms → appointment type / provider
+--------------------+
        |
        v
+--------------------+
| F. Scheduling Agent|  Propose available slots / booking request
+--------------------+
        |
        v
+--------------------+
| G. Guidance &      |  Owner do/don't guidance + clinic summary
|    Summary Agent   |
+--------------------+
        |
        v
  Owner Response + Clinic-Facing Summary
```

### 2.2 Sub-Agent Responsibilities

| Agent | Input | Output | Key Logic |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Pre-Intake Guardrails** | Raw user message | Block / pass decision | Comprehensive content-safety screen (`guardrails.py`): 8 categories (prompt injection, data extraction, violence/weapons, sexual/explicit, human-as-pet, substance abuse, abuse/harassment, trolling/off-topic). OWASP LLM Top 10 coverage. Leet-speak normalization, multilingual (7 langs), pet-medical exemptions. Plus: grief detection, non-pet redirect, normal behavior handling. |
| **A. Intake** | Owner free-text | Structured pet profile + symptoms | Adaptive follow-ups by species + symptom area |
| **B. Safety Gate** | Structured symptoms | Red-flag boolean + escalation message | Rule-based matching against known emergencies |
| **C. Confidence Gate** | All collected fields | Confidence score + missing fields | Required-field validation + uncertainty check |
| **D. Triage** | Validated intake data | Urgency tier + rationale + confidence | Classification with evidence |
| **E. Routing** | Triage result + symptoms | Appointment type + provider pool | Clinic rule map lookup |
| **F. Scheduling** | Routing result + urgency | Available slots / booking payload | Mock calendar integration |
| **G. Guidance & Summary** | All agent outputs | Owner guidance + clinic JSON summary | Safe non-diagnostic language |

### 2.3 Autonomy Boundaries

| The agent CAN | The agent CANNOT |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Collect intake information | Give a diagnosis |
| Suggest triage urgency tier | Prescribe medications or dosing |
| Suggest appointment routing | Override clinic policy |
| Generate booking request | Finalize emergency decisions without escalation |
| Provide safe general guidance | Provide specific medical advice |
| Produce structured clinic summary | Store owner PII beyond the session |

### 2.4 Technology Stack

### 2.5 Data Sources

**Operational data (used at runtime)** — the only data the system loads:

| Source | What It Provides | Agent(s) |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| `backend/data/clinic_rules.json` | Synthetic clinic routing maps, 4 providers, species notes | Routing (E) |
| `backend/data/red_flags.json` | 50+ curated emergency triggers (informed by ASPCA + vet emergency guidelines) | Safety Gate (B) |
| `backend/data/available_slots.json` | Mock clinic schedule (weekday 9-5, 30-min slots, 4 providers) | Scheduling (F) |

**Design references (not used at runtime)** — consulted when curating the files above; not loaded or called by the system:

| Source | What It Provides | How we used it |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| [HuggingFace pet-health-symptoms-dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/karenwky/pet-health-symptoms-dataset) | 2,000 labeled symptom samples (5 conditions) | Symptom taxonomy ideas |
| [ASPCA AnTox / Top Toxins](https://www.aspcapro.org/antox) | Toxin ingestion red flags (1M+ cases) | Red-flag phrasing in `red_flags.json` |
| [Vet-AI Symptom Checker](https://www.vet-ai.com/symptomchecker) | Commercial product (165 vet-written algorithms) | Triage workflow design |
| [SAVSNET / PetBERT](https://github.com/SAVSNET/PetBERT) | Veterinary NLP (500M+ words, 5.1M records) | NLP / coding patterns |

**Data strategy:** All POC data is synthetic. No real PHI. Deployment is **Render**. LangSmith observability is **live on Render**. N8N webhook integration and Twilio click-to-call are **code-ready** (opt-in via env vars) but not deployed for POC demo.

## 3. Design Decisions and Trade-offs

### 3.1 Key Considerations

| Consideration | Decision | Rationale |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| **Safety vs. Convenience** | Conservative triage (escalate when uncertain) | Under-triage is far more dangerous than over-triage |
| **Latency vs. Accuracy** | Target < 15s for full intake summary | Acceptable for async intake; interactive parts are streamed |
| **Cost vs. Quality** | Route simple cases to smaller models | Only use deep reasoning for ambiguous triage |
| **Privacy** | Session-only memory, no persistent PII | Privacy-by-design; compliant with veterinary data norms |
| **Autonomy** | Never auto-send; always show human what agent decided | Clinic staff retain final authority |

### 3.2 Why an Agent (vs. Simpler Alternatives)?

A static prompt or rule-based system is insufficient because:
- The workflow is **multi-step and branching** (follow-up questions depend on symptoms and species)
- **Red-flag detection** requires both rule-based checks and contextual understanding
- **Routing logic** involves mapping symptom categories to appointment types with uncertainty handling
- The system must **escalate safely** when confidence is low or signals conflict

### 3.3 Orchestrator vs. Agent Framework (LangGraph / Google ADK)

We use a **custom Python orchestrator** rather than a formal agent framework for the POC.

| Option | Decision | Rationale |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Custom orchestrator** | ✅ Used | Simple, debuggable, matches assignment emphasis on "simplicity and robustness" and "fewest steps." Branching (emergency, clarification) is explicit in code and in architecture diagrams. |
| **LangGraph** | Optional post-POC | Same flow; would give an explicit graph, checkpointing, and visualization (e.g. LangGraph Studio). Not required for the POC. |
| **Google ADK** | Not used | Vertex AI–centric and off our stack (OpenAI, Flask). Heavier than needed for this POC. |

The same 7-agent flow could be formalized in LangGraph later without changing agent logic; the report and demo can note "orchestration could be formalized in LangGraph for production" as a next step.

## 4. Evaluation

### 4.1 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Method |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Triage tier agreement with clinic staff | ≥ 80% | 100% (6/6) | Synthetic test set + manual review |
| Routing accuracy (correct appointment type) | ≥ 80% | 100% (4/4 non-emergency routed cases) | Gold-label comparison: GI→sick_visit_urgent, derm→sick_visit_routine, wellness→wellness all correct |
| Intake completeness (% required fields) | ≥ 90% | 100% (5/6 scenarios — scenario 1 routed via emergency path) | Automated field-presence check |
| Red flag detection | 100% | 100% (2/2) | Synthetic emergency scenarios |
| Receptionist time reduction per case | 30%+ | ~96% (8.4s avg vs ~240s manual baseline) | Timed comparison against 10-question manual intake script |
| Re-booking / mis-booking reduction | 20%+ | 100% first-attempt routing (4/4) | All non-emergency cases routed to correct appointment type on first pass; no simulated re-bookings required |

### 4.2 Test Set

We used two complementary test sets:

**Automated Evaluation (6 scenarios)** — executed via `backend/evaluate.py` with gold labels defined in [docs/BASELINE_METHODOLOGY.md](docs/BASELINE_METHODOLOGY.md):

| # | Scenario | Species | Gold Urgency | Gold Red Flag | Gold Routing | Result |
|---|----------|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Respiratory distress (fast breathing, pale gums, collapse) | Dog | Emergency | Yes | emergency | ✅ Pass |
| 2 | Chronic skin itching (1 week, eating normally) | Cat | Soon / Routine | No | dermatological | ✅ Pass |
| 3 | Chocolate toxin ingestion (dark chocolate, 1 hour ago) | Dog | Emergency | Yes | emergency | ✅ Pass |
| 4 | Ambiguous multi-turn ("pet isn't doing well" → scratching + head shaking) | Dog | Same-day / Soon | No | dermatological | ✅ Pass |
| 5 | French-language vomiting + appetite loss (2 days) | Cat | Same-day | No | gastrointestinal | ✅ Pass |
| 6 | Wellness check (annual shots, healthy) | Dog | Routine | No | wellness | ✅ Pass |

**Manual Test Cases (18 of 30 executed)** — run via `backend/run_manual_tests.py` and recorded in [testcases.md](testcases.md):

| Category | Tests | Passed | Failed | Not Tested |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|------------|
| Emergency (red flags) | TC-01 to TC-05 | 4 | 1 (TC-04) | 0 |
| Routine / Same-day | TC-06 to TC-08 | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| Ambiguous / Clarification | TC-09, TC-10 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| Multilingual | TC-11 to TC-13 | — | — | 3 (browser) |
| Multi-turn / Edge cases | TC-14 to TC-16 | 2 | 0 | 1 |
| Safety boundary | TC-17 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| API / Infrastructure | TC-18 to TC-20, I01–I03 | 5 | 0 | 1 (Docker) |
| Voice | TC-V01 to TC-V07 | — | — | 7 (mic req.) |
| **Total** | **30** | **17** | **1** | **12** |

**Overall pass rate: 94.4% (17/18 executed).** The single failure (TC-04: urinary blockage) is a known Safety Gate substring-matching gap documented in Section 4.5 and testcases.md.

### 4.3 Baseline Comparison

Baseline used: **Option 1 — Manual receptionist phone-call script (non-AI)**, as defined in **[docs/BASELINE_METHODOLOGY.md](docs/BASELINE_METHODOLOGY.md)** (author: Diana Liu). A human receptionist follows a fixed 10-question intake script; comparisons use the same synthetic scenarios and metrics (M1–M6: intake completeness, triage agreement, routing accuracy, red-flag detection, time reduction, mis-booking proxy). Gold labels are agreed before testing. Fill the results table in that document during evaluation runs.

### 4.4 Strong Example

**Scenario: Chocolate ingestion (Toxin emergency)**

The owner sends: *"My dog ate a whole bar of dark chocolate about an hour ago."*

The system correctly:
1. **Intake Agent (A):** Extracted species (dog), chief complaint (chocolate ingestion), timeline (1 hour ago)
2. **Safety Gate (B):** Detected red flag "chocolate" from the curated red-flag list and triggered immediate emergency escalation
3. **Guidance Agent (G):** Generated emergency-specific guidance ("do not induce vomiting unless directed by a vet") and a structured clinic summary

The pipeline completed in ~3 seconds (fast because the emergency path skips Confidence Gate, Triage, Routing, and Scheduling). The system correctly escalated without attempting to triage or book an appointment — matching the gold label of "Emergency."

This demonstrates the safety-first design: the deterministic rule-based Safety Gate catches the emergency before any LLM reasoning occurs, ensuring 100% detection reliability for known toxin scenarios.

### 4.5 Failure Case

**Scenario: Ambiguous multi-turn with vague initial description**

The owner sends: *"My pet isn't doing well."*

The system initially struggles because:
1. **Intake Agent (A):** No species, no specific complaint — both required fields are missing
2. The system asks a follow-up: "What type of pet do you have?"
3. After the owner replies "dog" and "he's been scratching a lot," the pipeline completes with the correct "Soon" triage tier

**What went well:** The clarification loop worked correctly — the system asked for missing required fields and completed intake once species + complaint were known.

**What could improve:** The initial follow-up question is generic ("What type of pet do you have?") rather than empathetic. A production system should use warmer language (e.g., "I'm sorry to hear that. To help, could you tell me what kind of pet you have and what symptoms you're seeing?").

> **Update (March 7, 2026):** Adversarial and nonsensical input is now handled by the comprehensive guardrails module (`backend/guardrails.py`), which screens all user messages against 8 content-safety categories before the LLM is called. This includes trolling/off-topic detection, prompt injection prevention, and multilingual pattern matching across all 7 supported languages.

---

## 5. Risk Analysis

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Under-triage (serious case labeled routine) | **High** | Medium | Conservative red-flag rules; mandatory escalation messaging; default to "contact clinic" when uncertain |
| Over-triage (too many urgent flags) | Medium | Medium | Calibrate thresholds with scenario tests; allow receptionist override; track override rate |
| Bad routing (wrong appointment type) | Medium | Medium | Clinic-owned routing map with version control; track override reasons |
| LLM hallucination in owner guidance | **High** | Low | Strict non-diagnostic language constraints; rule-based safety gate; template-based guidance |
| Prompt injection / jailbreak | **High** | Medium | Comprehensive pre-intake guardrails (`guardrails.py`) with 15+ prompt injection regex patterns, DAN/jailbreak detection, system prompt leak prevention, leet-speak normalization; runs before any LLM call |
| Adversarial / toxic input | Medium | Medium | 8-category content-safety screen (OWASP LLM Top 10): violence, sexual, substance abuse, abuse/harassment, trolling, human-as-pet; multilingual (7 langs); 181-case test suite |
| Owner provides misleading info | Medium | Medium | Confidence gate + targeted follow-ups; "needs human review" flag |
| API latency exceeds target | Medium | Medium | Limit model calls via smart routing; cache static rules |

---

## 6. Feasibility and Next Steps

### 6.1 Is This Viable Beyond POC?

Based on evaluation results (100% M2 triage accuracy, 100% M4 red-flag detection, ~96% time reduction vs manual baseline), the system demonstrates strong viability for production deployment with the following caveats:

| Factor | POC Finding | Production Readiness |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **Triage accuracy** | 100% (6/6) — exceeds the 80% threshold | ✅ Ready. Expand test set to 50+ scenarios with real vet-reviewed gold labels before clinical deployment. |
| **Red-flag safety** | 100% (2/2) known emergencies detected; 1 miss on phrasing variant (TC-04 urinary blockage) | 🟡 Needs improvement. Add fuzzy matching or synonym expansion to Safety Gate for broader keyword coverage. |
| **Intake experience** | Structured, empathetic flow with clarification loops; 7-language support; average 8.4s end-to-end | ✅ Ready. Usability testing with real pet owners recommended. |
| **Scheduling integration** | Mock calendar with synthetic slots | 🔴 Not ready. Requires integration with real clinic APIs (Vet360, PetDesk, or custom). |
| **Cost per session** | ~$0.01 (3 GPT-4o-mini calls per complete pipeline) | ✅ Viable. At 100 sessions/day = ~$1/day in LLM costs. |
| **Data privacy** | Session-only memory, no persistent PII, PIPEDA/PHIPA consent banner | ✅ POC-ready. Production needs formal privacy impact assessment. |

### 6.2 Immediate Next Steps for Deployment Readiness

1. Integrate with a real clinic scheduling system API (Vet360, PetDesk)
2. Add persistent session storage (Redis/PostgreSQL) for audit trail and multi-instance deployment
3. Deploy N8N webhook endpoint and configure Twilio account to activate the code-ready notification and click-to-call features
4. Conduct usability testing with real clinic receptionists
5. Calibrate triage thresholds with veterinary advisor feedback
6. Add clinic verification/override step before sending final response to owner
7. Formalize orchestration with LangGraph for explicit graph visualization and checkpointing

**Already completed in POC:** Species coverage expanded (dogs, cats, birds, reptiles, fish, horses, exotic pets); 7-language support with full UI translation; HTTP Basic Auth; two-tier session persistence (24hr PDF access); PWA mobile installation; consumer features (streaming, vet finder, PDF, photo analysis, cost estimator, feedback, reminders, breed alerts, dark mode, onboarding).

### C. Prompts Used

The system uses 3 LLM-powered agents (GPT-4o-mini) and 4 rule-based agents (no LLM). System prompts for each LLM agent:

#### Agent A: Intake Agent (`backend/agents/intake_agent.py`)

```
You are a veterinary intake assistant collecting pet symptom information.

HARD RULES — never violate:
1. NEVER name a disease, condition, or diagnosis
2. NEVER suggest medications or dosages
3. NEVER say "your pet has", "this sounds like", "this could be"
4. ONLY collect: species, symptoms as described, duration, eating/drinking,
   energy level. ANY animal is a valid species.
5. Do NOT comment on urgency at all
6. Respond in {lang_name}. JSON keys must stay in English.
7. Respond ONLY with valid JSON. No markdown fences.

You must respond with EXACTLY this JSON structure:
{
  "pet_profile": {"species": "", "pet_name": "", "breed": "",
                   "age": "", "weight": ""},
  "chief_complaint": "",
  "symptom_details": {"area": "", "timeline": "",
                       "eating_drinking": "", "energy_level": "",
                       "additional": ""},
  "follow_up_questions": [],
  "intake_complete": false
}

Rules for intake_complete:
- TRUE only when species AND a REAL chief_complaint are BOTH known
- chief_complaint must describe a HEALTH CONCERN, SYMPTOM, or REASON FOR VISIT
- Set to false and ask follow-up if missing species OR missing chief_complaint
- follow_up_questions: at most ONE plain string

For symptom_details.area use only: gastrointestinal, respiratory,
dermatological, injury, urinary, neurological, behavioral, or empty string.
```

#### Agent D: Triage Agent (`backend/agents/triage_agent.py`)

```
You are a veterinary triage classification assistant.
Your ONLY job is to classify urgency.

HARD RULES — never violate:
1. NEVER name a disease, condition, or diagnosis in any field
2. NEVER suggest medications or treatments
3. The rationale field is read ONLY by clinic staff — use clinical
   observation language but NO diagnosis names
4. Be conservative but accurate — Reserve Emergency only for immediate
   life-threatening presentations: collapse, inability to breathe,
   active seizure, known toxin ingestion, severe trauma,
   or uncontrolled bleeding.
5. Respond ONLY with valid JSON

Urgency tiers:
- Emergency: life-threatening, go to ER now
- Same-day: significant concern, must be seen today
- Soon: non-urgent, seen within 1-3 days
- Routine: standard wellness or minor concern

Respond with exactly:
{
  "urgency_tier": "Emergency|Same-day|Soon|Routine",
  "rationale": "brief clinical observation — no diagnosis names",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "contributing_factors": ["observable factor 1", "factor 2"]
}
```

**User prompt template:** `Species: {species} | Chief complaint: {complaint} | Timeline: {timeline} | Eating/drinking: {eating} | Energy level: {energy}`

#### Agent G: Guidance & Summary Agent (`backend/agents/guidance_summary.py`)

```
You are a veterinary intake assistant writing safe waiting guidance
for a worried pet owner.

CRITICAL: The pet is a **{species}**. ALWAYS refer to it as a {species}.

HARD RULES — never violate:
1. NEVER name a disease, condition, or diagnosis
2. NEVER suggest a specific medication, supplement, or dosage
3. NEVER say "your pet has", "this sounds like", "this could be"
4. In watch_for: ONLY describe observable physical signs
5. Be warm, clear, and reassuring — the owner is worried
6. Respond in {lang_name}. JSON keys must remain in English.
7. Respond ONLY with valid JSON

Respond with exactly:
{
  "do": ["up to 4 safe actions the owner can take while waiting"],
  "dont": ["up to 3 things to avoid"],
  "watch_for": ["up to 3 observable signs that mean go to ER"]
}
```

**User prompt template:** `Urgency tier: {urgency_tier} | Pet species: {species} | Symptom area: {symptom_area} | Chief complaint: {chief_complaint}`

#### Rule-Based Agents (no LLM prompts)

| Agent | Logic Source | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Pre-Intake Guardrails | `backend/guardrails.py` (8 categories, ~100 regex patterns) | Comprehensive content-safety screen: prompt injection, data extraction, violence/weapons, sexual/explicit, human-as-pet, substance abuse, abuse/harassment, trolling/off-topic. Leet-speak normalization, multilingual (FR, ES, ZH, AR, HI, UR), pet-medical context exemptions. 181-case test suite. |
| B. Safety Gate | `backend/data/red_flags.json` (50+ keywords) | Substring matching against combined intake text |
| C. Confidence Gate | Required-field validation | Checks species + chief_complaint present, confidence ≥ 0.6 |
| E. Routing | `backend/data/clinic_rules.json` | Maps symptom area → appointment type + provider pool |
| F. Scheduling | `backend/data/available_slots.json` | Filters slots by urgency tier + provider availability |
