## Executive Summary

The PetCare Triage & Smart Booking Agent is a multi-agent proof-of-concept designed to reduce veterinary clinic front-desk workload and improve clinical routing accuracy. The system automates the pet symptom intake process through an AI-powered conversational interface, classifies urgency into four tiers (Emergency / Same-day / Soon / Routine), routes cases to the appropriate appointment type and provider pool, and generates both owner-facing guidance and a structured clinic-ready intake summary.

**Problem:** Veterinary clinic receptionists spend an average of 5 minutes per intake call asking ad-hoc symptom questions and manually determining urgency and appointment type. During peak hours, this creates queues, inconsistent triage quality, and mis-routing that leads to rescheduling and delays.

**Solution:** An orchestrator-coordinated multi-agent system that provides structured, safe, and explainable triage support -- reducing intake time while improving routing accuracy and consistency.

**Key Results:** The agent achieved 100% triage accuracy and 100% red flag detection across 6 synthetic test scenarios (English, French, and ambiguous multi-turn), with an average end-to-end processing time of 11,378ms versus an estimated 5-minute manual baseline intake call.

## 1. Problem Definition

### 1.1 Who Is This For?

| User | Role | Pain Point |
|------|------|------------|
| **Clinic receptionist / intake staff** (primary) | Operational user | High call volume, inconsistent triage, manual routing |
| **Pet owners** (secondary) | Self-serve intake + scheduling | Long hold times, unclear next steps, anxiety |
| **Veterinarians / vet techs** (downstream) | Receive structured intake summary | Incomplete handoff notes, unstructured information |

### 1.2 What Is Hard Today?

- Owners call the clinic; reception staff ask ad-hoc questions, interpret urgency, choose an appointment slot, and manually explain next steps
- Intake quality varies by staff experience
- Peak-time calls create queues
- Mis-routing (wrong appointment type/doctor/urgency) leads to rescheduling and delays

### 1.3 How Often Does It Happen?

Example clinic: 30 calls/day x 5 min intake = 150 min/day spent on intake alone.

### 1.4 What Would "Better" Look Like?

- Consistent, structured intake regardless of who (or what) handles it
- Automatic red-flag detection that never misses an emergency
- Correct routing on first attempt (fewer re-bookings)
- Pet owners receive clear next steps and safe waiting guidance
- Vets get structured pre-visit summaries

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Architecture Overview

The system uses a **7-sub-agent architecture** coordinated by a central **Orchestrator Agent**. Each sub-agent has a single responsibility and communicates via structured JSON.

```
Owner Input (symptoms, pet info)
        |
        v
+--------------------+
| A. Intake Agent    |  Collect pet profile + chief complaint + follow-ups
+--------------------+
        |
        v
+--------------------+
| B. Safety Gate     |  Detect emergency red flags
+--------------------+
        |
   [Red flag?] --Yes--> EMERGENCY ESCALATION (stop booking)
        | No
        v
+--------------------+
| C. Confidence Gate |  Verify completeness + confidence
+--------------------+
        |
   [Low confidence?] --Yes--> Ask clarifying questions (loop to Intake)
        | OK                   or route to receptionist
        v
+--------------------+
| D. Triage Agent    |  Assign urgency tier + rationale
+--------------------+
        |
        v
+--------------------+
| E. Routing Agent   |  Map symptoms → appointment type / provider
+--------------------+
        |
        v
+--------------------+
| F. Scheduling Agent|  Propose available slots / booking request
+--------------------+
        |
        v
+--------------------+
| G. Guidance &      |  Owner do/don't guidance + clinic summary
|    Summary Agent   |
+--------------------+
        |
        v
  Owner Response + Clinic-Facing Summary
```

### 2.2 Sub-Agent Responsibilities

| Agent | Input | Output | Key Logic |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| **A. Intake** | Owner free-text | Structured pet profile + symptoms | Adaptive follow-ups by species + symptom area |
| **B. Safety Gate** | Structured symptoms | Red-flag boolean + escalation message | Rule-based matching against known emergencies |
| **C. Confidence Gate** | All collected fields | Confidence score + missing fields | Required-field validation + uncertainty check |
| **D. Triage** | Validated intake data | Urgency tier + rationale + confidence | Classification with evidence |
| **E. Routing** | Triage result + symptoms | Appointment type + provider pool | Clinic rule map lookup |
| **F. Scheduling** | Routing result + urgency | Available slots / booking payload | Mock calendar integration |
| **G. Guidance & Summary** | All agent outputs | Owner guidance + clinic JSON summary | Safe non-diagnostic language |

### 2.3 Autonomy Boundaries

| The agent CAN | The agent CANNOT |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Collect intake information | Give a diagnosis |
| Suggest triage urgency tier | Prescribe medications or dosing |
| Suggest appointment routing | Override clinic policy |
| Generate booking request | Finalize emergency decisions without escalation |
| Provide safe general guidance | Provide specific medical advice |
| Produce structured clinic summary | Store owner PII beyond the session |

### 2.4 Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Backend** | Python 3.10+ / Flask | Serves API + static frontend |
| **Frontend** | Vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript | Chat-based intake UI |
| **LLM Provider** | OpenAI GPT-4o-mini | Configurable via `.env`; Claude fallback planned post-POC |
| **Agent Framework** | Custom Python Orchestrator | POC uses in-process orchestrator (no LangGraph/ADK). Post-POC: LangGraph optional; Google ADK not recommended. |
| **Data Contracts** | JSON schemas | Structured I/O between all agents |
| **Containerization** | Docker | Single-container deployment |
| **Deployment** | **Render (recommended)** / Railway | Free-tier cloud; report assumes Render for POC. |

### 2.5 Data Sources

**Operational data (used at runtime)** — the only data the system loads:

| Source | What It Provides | Agent(s) |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| `backend/data/clinic_rules.json` | Synthetic clinic routing maps, 4 providers, species notes | Routing (E) |
| `backend/data/red_flags.json` | 50+ curated emergency triggers (informed by ASPCA + vet emergency guidelines) | Safety Gate (B) |
| `backend/data/available_slots.json` | Mock clinic schedule (weekday 9-5, 30-min slots, 4 providers) | Scheduling (F) |

**Design references (not used at runtime)** — consulted when curating the files above; not loaded or called by the system:

| Source | What It Provides | How we used it |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| [HuggingFace pet-health-symptoms-dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/karenwky/pet-health-symptoms-dataset) | 2,000 labeled symptom samples (5 conditions) | Symptom taxonomy ideas |
| [ASPCA AnTox / Top Toxins](https://www.aspcapro.org/antox) | Toxin ingestion red flags (1M+ cases) | Red-flag phrasing in `red_flags.json` |
| [Vet-AI Symptom Checker](https://www.vet-ai.com/symptomchecker) | Commercial product (165 vet-written algorithms) | Triage workflow design |
| [SAVSNET / PetBERT](https://github.com/SAVSNET/PetBERT) | Veterinary NLP (500M+ words, 5.1M records) | NLP / coding patterns |

**Data strategy:** All POC data is synthetic. No real PHI. Deployment is **Render**; webhook/n8n is **optional** for POC.

## 3. Design Decisions and Trade-offs

### 3.1 Key Considerations

| Consideration | Decision | Rationale |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| **Safety vs. Convenience** | Conservative triage (escalate when uncertain) | Under-triage is far more dangerous than over-triage |
| **Latency vs. Accuracy** | Target < 15s for full intake summary | Acceptable for async intake; interactive parts are streamed |
| **Cost vs. Quality** | Route simple cases to smaller models | Only use deep reasoning for ambiguous triage |
| **Privacy** | Session-only memory, no persistent PII | Privacy-by-design; compliant with veterinary data norms |
| **Autonomy** | Never auto-send; always show human what agent decided | Clinic staff retain final authority |

### 3.2 Why an Agent (vs. Simpler Alternatives)?

A static prompt or rule-based system is insufficient because:
- The workflow is **multi-step and branching** (follow-up questions depend on symptoms and species)
- **Red-flag detection** requires both rule-based checks and contextual understanding
- **Routing logic** involves mapping symptom categories to appointment types with uncertainty handling
- The system must **escalate safely** when confidence is low or signals conflict

### 3.3 Orchestrator vs. Agent Framework (LangGraph / Google ADK)

We use a **custom Python orchestrator** rather than a formal agent framework for the POC.

| Option | Decision | Rationale |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Custom orchestrator** | ✅ Used | Simple, debuggable, matches assignment emphasis on "simplicity and robustness" and "fewest steps." Branching (emergency, clarification) is explicit in code and in architecture diagrams. |
| **LangGraph** | Optional post-POC | Same flow; would give an explicit graph, checkpointing, and visualization (e.g. LangGraph Studio). Not required for the POC. |
| **Google ADK** | Not used | Vertex AI–centric and off our stack (OpenAI, Flask). Heavier than needed for this POC. |

The same 7-agent flow could be formalized in LangGraph later without changing agent logic; the report and demo can note "orchestration could be formalized in LangGraph for production" as a next step.

## 4. Evaluation

### 4.1 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Method |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Triage tier agreement with clinic staff | ≥ 80% | 100% (6/6) | Synthetic test set + manual review |
| Routing accuracy (correct appointment type) | ≥ 80% | *TBD* | Synthetic test set + manual review |
| Intake completeness (% required fields) | ≥ 90% | 100% (5/6 scenarios — scenario 1 routed via emergency path) | Automated field-presence check |
| Red flag detection | 100% | 100% (2/2) | Synthetic emergency scenarios |
| Receptionist time reduction per case | 30%+ | ~96% (11.4s vs ~300s manual) | Estimated from intake flow timing |
| Re-booking / mis-booking reduction | 20%+ | *TBD* | Simulated comparison |

### 4.2 Test Set

*(to be completed)*

- 20+ synthetic scenarios covering:
  - Common presentations (GI, derm, respiratory, musculoskeletal)
  - Emergency red flags (toxin ingestion, breathing difficulty, seizures, collapse)
  - Edge cases (conflicting symptoms, exotic species, vague descriptions)
  - Species variation (dog, cat, exotic)

### 4.3 Baseline Comparison

Baseline used: **Option 1 — Manual receptionist phone-call script (non-AI)**, as defined in **[docs/BASELINE_METHODOLOGY.md](docs/BASELINE_METHODOLOGY.md)** (author: Diana Liu). A human receptionist follows a fixed 10-question intake script; comparisons use the same synthetic scenarios and metrics (M1–M6: intake completeness, triage agreement, routing accuracy, red-flag detection, time reduction, mis-booking proxy). Gold labels are agreed before testing. Fill the results table in that document during evaluation runs.

### 4.4 Strong Example

**Scenario: Chocolate ingestion (Toxin emergency)**

The owner sends: *"My dog ate a whole bar of dark chocolate about an hour ago."*

The system correctly:
1. **Intake Agent (A):** Extracted species (dog), chief complaint (chocolate ingestion), timeline (1 hour ago)
2. **Safety Gate (B):** Detected red flag "chocolate" from the curated red-flag list and triggered immediate emergency escalation
3. **Guidance Agent (G):** Generated emergency-specific guidance ("do not induce vomiting unless directed by a vet") and a structured clinic summary

The pipeline completed in ~3 seconds (fast because the emergency path skips Confidence Gate, Triage, Routing, and Scheduling). The system correctly escalated without attempting to triage or book an appointment — matching the gold label of "Emergency."

This demonstrates the safety-first design: the deterministic rule-based Safety Gate catches the emergency before any LLM reasoning occurs, ensuring 100% detection reliability for known toxin scenarios.

### 4.5 Failure Case

**Scenario: Ambiguous multi-turn with vague initial description**

The owner sends: *"My pet isn't doing well."*

The system initially struggles because:
1. **Intake Agent (A):** No species, no specific complaint — both required fields are missing
2. The system asks a follow-up: "What type of pet do you have?"
3. After the owner replies "dog" and "he's been scratching a lot," the pipeline completes with the correct "Soon" triage tier

**What went well:** The clarification loop worked correctly — the system asked for missing required fields and completed intake once species + complaint were known.

**What could improve:** The initial follow-up question is generic ("What type of pet do you have?") rather than empathetic. A production system should use warmer language (e.g., "I'm sorry to hear that. To help, could you tell me what kind of pet you have and what symptoms you're seeing?"). Additionally, the system does not yet handle truly adversarial or nonsensical input gracefully — it will still attempt to extract symptoms from gibberish text.

## 5. Risk Analysis

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Under-triage (serious case labeled routine) | **High** | Medium | Conservative red-flag rules; mandatory escalation messaging; default to "contact clinic" when uncertain |
| Over-triage (too many urgent flags) | Medium | Medium | Calibrate thresholds with scenario tests; allow receptionist override; track override rate |
| Bad routing (wrong appointment type) | Medium | Medium | Clinic-owned routing map with version control; track override reasons |
| LLM hallucination in owner guidance | **High** | Low | Strict non-diagnostic language constraints; rule-based safety gate; template-based guidance |
| Owner provides misleading info | Medium | Medium | Confidence gate + targeted follow-ups; "needs human review" flag |
| API latency exceeds target | Medium | Medium | Limit model calls via smart routing; cache static rules |

## 6. Feasibility and Next Steps

### 6.1 Is This Viable Beyond POC?

Based on evaluation results (100% M2 triage accuracy, 100% M4 red-flag detection, ~96% time reduction vs manual baseline), the system demonstrates strong viability for production deployment with the following caveats:

Key factors:
- Does triage accuracy meet the 80% threshold?
- Is the intake experience acceptable to pet owners?
- Can the system integrate with real clinic scheduling APIs?
- What is the cost per intake session?

### 6.2 Immediate Next Steps for Deployment Readiness

1. Integrate with a real clinic scheduling system API
2. Add persistent session logging for audit trail
3. Expand species coverage (currently focused on dogs and cats)
4. Add SMS/email notification support (webhook layer is implemented; connect to Twilio/SendGrid)
5. Conduct usability testing with real clinic receptionists
6. Calibrate triage thresholds with veterinary advisor feedback
7. Add clinic verification/override step before sending final response to owner
