## Branch: `main` — POC 1.2 Enhancements

### 2026-03-07 — POC 1.2: Comprehensive Dynamic Guardrails + Multilingual Species Fix

**Comprehensive Dynamic Guardrails** (`enhance/dynamic-guardrails`):
- Created standalone `backend/guardrails.py` module (~415 lines) — OWASP LLM Top 10 coverage
- **8 guardrail categories**, each with compiled regex patterns:
  1. **Prompt injection / jailbreak** (OWASP LLM01, LLM07): ignore instructions, DAN, mode switches, jailbreak, reveal system prompt, inject fake system message, roleplay-as-X, encoded payloads
  2. **Data extraction** (OWASP LLM02): API keys, tokens, credentials, env vars, config file requests
  3. **Violence / weapons**: creating weapons/explosives, terrorism, self-harm, animal cruelty, weapon/ammo terms
  4. **Sexual / explicit**: pornography, bestiality, explicit acts, body parts (non-medical context only), sex toys, solicitation, slurs
  5. **Human-as-pet**: treating humans as animals, leashing/caging humans
  6. **Substance abuse**: giving pets drugs/alcohol (non-medical — "my dog ate marijuana" exempt as medical emergency)
  7. **Abuse / harassment**: directed profanity, threats against bot/staff, slurs (N-word, F-slur, R-word, C-word)
  8. **Trolling / off-topic**: crypto, homework, code writing, conspiracy, dating, gambling, roleplay-as-boyfriend
- **Leet-speak normalization** (`str.maketrans`): `0→o, 1→i, 3→e, 4→a, 5→s, 7→t, 8→b, @→a, $→s, !→i, +→t`
- **Multilingual patterns** for FR, ES, ZH, AR, HI, UR in 6 categories (sexual, violence, abuse, drugs, prompt injection, human-as-pet)
- **Pet-medical context exemption**: legitimate emergencies (e.g. "my dog ate rat poison", "my cat drank antifreeze") bypass violence/substance/sexual categories
- All responses localized in 7 languages via `_GUARDRAIL_STRINGS` (5 new response keys × 7 languages)
- **181-case test suite** (`test_guardrails.py`) covering all 8 categories + leet-speak + multilingual + false-positive prevention
- Integrated into `_pre_intake_screen()` as check #1, before deceased/non-pet/normal-behavior checks

**Multilingual Species Recognition Fix** (`enhance/dynamic-guardrails`):
- Added Hindi, Urdu, Arabic, Chinese, French, Spanish species words to `IntakeAgent._SPECIES_WORDS`
- Added multilingual noise phrases to `IntakeAgent._NOISE_PHRASES`
- Added Hindi, Urdu, Arabic, Chinese species keywords to orchestrator `_species_keywords` fallback
- Fixed: "कुत्ता" (dog), "बिल्ली" (cat) etc. now correctly recognized as species (not treated as complaints)

## Branch: `main` — POC 1.1 Enhancements

### 2026-03-07 — POC 1.1: Guardrails, Diagnostic Intake, i18n, Observability, Integrations, UX

**Tag:** `v1.1.0-poc`

**Smart Intake Guardrails** (`enhance/smart-intake-guardrails`):
- Added `_pre_intake_screen()` — deterministic pre-LLM guardrail with 4 categories
- Abuse/threats: firm boundary, never engages
- Deceased pet: compassionate response + grief resources, marks session complete
- Non-pet subjects ("my human isn't well"): gentle redirect to human health services
- Normal animal behavior ("humping"): acknowledge as normal, no medical triage
- Smart false-positive prevention (pet+human co-mention, medical+behavior overlap)
- All responses localized in 7 languages via `_GUARDRAIL_STRINGS`

**Structured Diagnostic Follow-up** (`enhance/structured-intake-questions`):
- After species + chief complaint known, asks timeline → eating/drinking → energy level
- One question per turn, max 3 diagnostic turns, skips already-answered questions
- Species-personalized questions, localized in 7 languages

**Booking Confirmation Fix** (`fix/booking-confirmation`):
- Natural slot matching with score-based system: day name(+2), month(+1), day number(+1), time+ampm(+2), provider(+3), threshold ≥2
- "Tuesday March 10th 11am with Dr. Patel" now books without requiring "book" keyword

**Full Language Enforcement** (`fix/multi-language-enforcement`):
- `_UI_STRINGS` dict: 7 languages × 18 keys for all orchestrator messages
- `_RESTART_KEYWORDS_I18N` / `_BOOK_KEYWORDS_I18N`: per-language keyword sets
- `_t()` helper method for localized string retrieval
- Localized emergency messages, intake fallbacks (`_FALLBACK_ASK_SPECIES`, `_FALLBACK_ASK_SYMPTOMS`)
- Strengthened intake prompt rules 8 + 9 (never guess species)

**LangSmith Observability** (`enhance/langsmith-tracing`):
- `wrap_openai` on all 3 LLM agents (intake, triage, guidance)
- `@traceable` decorator on `orchestrator.process()`
- Opt-in via `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true` + `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`
- Added `langsmith` to requirements.txt

**N8N Webhook Integration** (`enhance/n8n-webhook`):
- Fires POST on terminal states (complete/emergency/booked) from `_build_response()`
- Payload: event, session_id, pet_profile, all agent outputs, booked_slot, language, processing_time
- Non-blocking with 5s timeout, failures logged as warnings

**Twilio Click-to-Call** (`enhance/twilio-voice`):
- Backend `/api/call` endpoint using Twilio REST API
- Backend `/api/twilio/status` for frontend feature detection
- Frontend "Call via app" button on vet cards when Twilio is enabled
- Phone number validation (E.164), opt-in via Twilio env vars
- Native `tel:` links still work regardless

**Scroll Bug Fix** (`fix/scroll-bug`):
- Centralized `_scrollToBottom(behavior)` helper: 'smooth' default, 'instant' during typing
- `_isNearBottom()` helper for future user-is-reading detection
- Removed CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth` (now controlled via JS)
- Replaced all 12 raw `scrollTop = scrollHeight` calls

### 2026-03-02 — Baseline methodology from diana-baseline branch

**Commit:** `docs: integrate BASELINE_METHODOLOGY from diana-baseline (author Diana Liu)`

- **Added** `docs/BASELINE_METHODOLOGY.md` from `diana-baseline` branch (author: Diana Liu). Defines **Baseline-1: Manual receptionist phone-call script (non-AI)** — 10-question intake script, manual red-flag review, urgency tier, routing, scheduling. Includes shared test set, gold labels table, evaluation metrics M1–M6, results table template, step-by-step comparison procedure, voice scope (non-blocking for MVP), threats to validity, and evidence artifacts. Used to evaluate the 7-agent system against a realistic status-quo baseline.
- **Updated** `README.md` Documentation table to link to baseline methodology.
- **Updated** `technical_report.md` §4.3 Baseline Comparison to reference the document and Option 1.
- **Updated** `docs/test_scenarios.md` to reference baseline comparison and BASELINE_METHODOLOGY.md.

### 2026-03-02 — Agent Design Canvas (MD) + Diana Liu as contributor

**Commit:** `docs: add Agent Design Canvas as MD (author Diana Liu), add Diana as contributor to design docs`

- **Added** `docs/AGENT_DESIGN_CANVAS.md` — Canonical Agent Design Canvas converted from the Word canvas; author **Diana Liu**. Same format: STEP 1 (Problem Definition), STEP 2 (Core Workflow with Mermaid diagram), STEP 3 (Capabilities & Memory), STEP 4 (Data & Constraints), STEP 5 (Success Criteria & Failure Analysis). Updated to reflect current 7-agent architecture, Flask, Render, voice, multilingual.
- **Added** Diana Liu as **Contributors** on all design docs: `agents.md`, `system_overview.md`, `orchestrator.md`, `data_model.md`, `repo_structure.md`, `output_schema.md`, `scope_and_roles.md`, `workflow_technical.md`, `workflow_non_technical.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `DESIGN_COMPARISON.md`, `test_scenarios.md`.
- **Updated** `docs/architecture/README.md` and main `README.md` Documentation table to link to the Agent Design Canvas.

### 2026-03-01 — Repository cleanup (PetCare-only)

**Commit:** `chore: remove resume/job-related and legacy files; PetCare-only repo`

Removed all files not relevant to the PetCare Triage & Smart Booking Agent:

- **Removed** `docs/agent_specs/jd_analysis/`, `resume_profiling/`, `application_strategy/`, `hidden_signal/`, `evidence_citation/`, `hard_match/` — these were from the resume-alignment-engine template; PetCare uses only `intake`, `safety_gate`, `confidence_gate`, `triage`, `routing`, `scheduling`, `guidance_summary`, `orchestrator`.
- **Removed** `src/` — legacy prototype code (Streamlit UI, JD/resume agent stubs). Active code lives in `backend/` and `frontend/`.
- **Removed** `docs/current_version/` — contained Resume Alignment Engine workflow guide; not applicable to PetCare.
- **Removed** empty duplicate directories (`docs/agent_specs 2`, `docs/architecture 2`, etc.).
- **Updated** `README.md` and `docs/architecture/repo_structure.md` to drop references to `src/` and `current_version/`.

### 2026-03-01 — Merge from main + content integration

**Commit:** `docs: integrate main-branch content — data model, test scenarios, voice safety, repo structure`

Compared the `main` branch docs against the `PetCare_Syed` branch and integrated all useful content:

- **Added** `docs/architecture/data_model.md` — Full field-level data schema for all JSON files and in-memory objects, data access policy matrix, privacy/security guidance. Based on main's `data-model.md` but aligned with our actual `clinic_rules.json`, `red_flags.json`, and `available_slots.json`.
- **Added** `docs/test_scenarios.md` — 6 end-to-end test scenarios (emergency, routine, toxin ingestion, ambiguous input, multilingual, voice with noise) with expected agent behavior tables and a validation checklist covering safety, pipeline correctness, output quality, voice, and multilingual.
- **Added** voice safety requirements to `TECH_STACK.md` — Critical field confirmation, red-flag double confirmation, confidence-based fallback, failure scenario table, testing requirements with WER targets. Sourced from main's `voice-extension.md`.
- **Added** data access policy matrix to `docs/architecture/agents.md` — Agent-level read/write permissions for all data stores, responsibility boundary rules for Triage, Scheduling, Safety Gate, and Guidance agents.
- **Added** `docs/architecture/repo_structure.md` — Complete repository layout with directory tree, file descriptions, and design rationale. Replaces main's outdated Google ADK-based structure.
- **Added** `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This file. Full project history.
- **Preserved** original main-branch docs in `docs/original_main/` for reference.

### 2026-03-01 — Migration to petcare-agentic-system

**Commit:** `feat: migrate PetCare project from resume-alignment-engine`

Migrated the full project from the `PetCare` branch on `FergieFeng/resume-alignment-engine` to the dedicated `FergieFeng/petcare-agentic-system` repository. All repo URL references updated. Original main-branch docs preserved in `docs/original_main/`.

### 2026-03-01 — Custom orchestrator decision documented

**Commit:** `docs: document custom orchestrator decision (no LangGraph/ADK for POC)`

Assessed Google ADK and LangGraph as agent frameworks. Decision: use custom Python orchestrator for POC (simpler, debuggable, meets assignment requirements). LangGraph documented as optional post-POC formalization. Google ADK not recommended (Vertex AI–centric). Updated: `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, `TECH_STACK.md`, `technical_report.md`, `docs/architecture/orchestrator.md`, `docs/architecture/system_overview.md`.

### 2026-03-01 — Mermaid diagram cleanup
