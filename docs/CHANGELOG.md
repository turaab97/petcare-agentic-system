## Branch: `PetCare_Syed` on `FergieFeng/petcare-agentic-system`

### 2026-03-02 — Baseline methodology from diana-baseline branch

**Commit:** `docs: integrate BASELINE_METHODOLOGY from diana-baseline (author Diana Liu)`

- **Added** `docs/BASELINE_METHODOLOGY.md` from `diana-baseline` branch (author: Diana Liu). Defines **Baseline-1: Manual receptionist phone-call script (non-AI)** — 10-question intake script, manual red-flag review, urgency tier, routing, scheduling. Includes shared test set, gold labels table, evaluation metrics M1–M6, results table template, step-by-step comparison procedure, voice scope (non-blocking for MVP), threats to validity, and evidence artifacts. Used to evaluate the 7-agent system against a realistic status-quo baseline.
- **Updated** `README.md` Documentation table to link to baseline methodology.
- **Updated** `technical_report.md` §4.3 Baseline Comparison to reference the document and Option 1.
- **Updated** `docs/test_scenarios.md` to reference baseline comparison and BASELINE_METHODOLOGY.md.

### 2026-03-02 — Agent Design Canvas (MD) + Diana Liu as contributor

**Commit:** `docs: add Agent Design Canvas as MD (author Diana Liu), add Diana as contributor to design docs`

- **Added** `docs/AGENT_DESIGN_CANVAS.md` — Canonical Agent Design Canvas converted from the Word canvas; author **Diana Liu**. Same format: STEP 1 (Problem Definition), STEP 2 (Core Workflow with Mermaid diagram), STEP 3 (Capabilities & Memory), STEP 4 (Data & Constraints), STEP 5 (Success Criteria & Failure Analysis). Updated to reflect current 7-agent architecture, Flask, Render, voice, multilingual.
- **Added** Diana Liu as **Contributors** on all design docs: `agents.md`, `system_overview.md`, `orchestrator.md`, `data_model.md`, `repo_structure.md`, `output_schema.md`, `scope_and_roles.md`, `workflow_technical.md`, `workflow_non_technical.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `DESIGN_COMPARISON.md`, `test_scenarios.md`.
- **Updated** `docs/architecture/README.md` and main `README.md` Documentation table to link to the Agent Design Canvas.

### 2026-03-01 — Repository cleanup (PetCare-only)

**Commit:** `chore: remove resume/job-related and legacy files; PetCare-only repo`

Removed all files not relevant to the PetCare Triage & Smart Booking Agent:

- **Removed** `docs/agent_specs/jd_analysis/`, `resume_profiling/`, `application_strategy/`, `hidden_signal/`, `evidence_citation/`, `hard_match/` — these were from the resume-alignment-engine template; PetCare uses only `intake`, `safety_gate`, `confidence_gate`, `triage`, `routing`, `scheduling`, `guidance_summary`, `orchestrator`.
- **Removed** `src/` — legacy prototype code (Streamlit UI, JD/resume agent stubs). Active code lives in `backend/` and `frontend/`.
- **Removed** `docs/current_version/` — contained Resume Alignment Engine workflow guide; not applicable to PetCare.
- **Removed** empty duplicate directories (`docs/agent_specs 2`, `docs/architecture 2`, etc.).
- **Updated** `README.md` and `docs/architecture/repo_structure.md` to drop references to `src/` and `current_version/`.

### 2026-03-01 — Merge from main + content integration

**Commit:** `docs: integrate main-branch content — data model, test scenarios, voice safety, repo structure`

Compared the `main` branch docs against the `PetCare_Syed` branch and integrated all useful content:

- **Added** `docs/architecture/data_model.md` — Full field-level data schema for all JSON files and in-memory objects, data access policy matrix, privacy/security guidance. Based on main's `data-model.md` but aligned with our actual `clinic_rules.json`, `red_flags.json`, and `available_slots.json`.
- **Added** `docs/test_scenarios.md` — 6 end-to-end test scenarios (emergency, routine, toxin ingestion, ambiguous input, multilingual, voice with noise) with expected agent behavior tables and a validation checklist covering safety, pipeline correctness, output quality, voice, and multilingual.
- **Added** voice safety requirements to `TECH_STACK.md` — Critical field confirmation, red-flag double confirmation, confidence-based fallback, failure scenario table, testing requirements with WER targets. Sourced from main's `voice-extension.md`.
- **Added** data access policy matrix to `docs/architecture/agents.md` — Agent-level read/write permissions for all data stores, responsibility boundary rules for Triage, Scheduling, Safety Gate, and Guidance agents.
- **Added** `docs/architecture/repo_structure.md` — Complete repository layout with directory tree, file descriptions, and design rationale. Replaces main's outdated Google ADK-based structure.
- **Added** `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This file. Full project history.
- **Preserved** original main-branch docs in `docs/original_main/` for reference.

### 2026-03-01 — Migration to petcare-agentic-system

**Commit:** `feat: migrate PetCare project from resume-alignment-engine`

Migrated the full project from the `PetCare` branch on `FergieFeng/resume-alignment-engine` to the dedicated `FergieFeng/petcare-agentic-system` repository. All repo URL references updated. Original main-branch docs preserved in `docs/original_main/`.

### 2026-03-01 — Custom orchestrator decision documented

**Commit:** `docs: document custom orchestrator decision (no LangGraph/ADK for POC)`

Assessed Google ADK and LangGraph as agent frameworks. Decision: use custom Python orchestrator for POC (simpler, debuggable, meets assignment requirements). LangGraph documented as optional post-POC formalization. Google ADK not recommended (Vertex AI–centric). Updated: `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, `TECH_STACK.md`, `technical_report.md`, `docs/architecture/orchestrator.md`, `docs/architecture/system_overview.md`.

### 2026-03-01 — Mermaid diagram cleanup

**Commits:** `fix: rewrite mermaid diagrams for clean GitHub rendering` (x2)

Rewrote all 4 mermaid diagrams in `README.md` for reliable GitHub rendering: flattened deep nesting, used node-to-node edges instead of cross-subgraph edges, shortened labels, added color coding. Diagrams: System Architecture, Agent Pipeline Flow, Voice Architecture, Deployment Roadmap.

### 2026-03-01 — n8n workflow automation integration

**Commit:** `feat: integrate n8n workflow automation as actions layer`

Added n8n as a post-intake actions layer. Created `docker-compose.yml` (petcare-agent + n8n containers). Defined 5 n8n workflows (Emergency Alert, Clinic Summary Delivery, Appointment Confirmation, Analytics Logger, Follow-Up Reminder). Added Phase 4 to `PROJECT_PLAN.md`. Updated `TECH_STACK.md`, `README.md`, `.env.example`.

### 2026-03-01 — Mermaid architecture diagrams + MMAI 891 update

**Commit:** `feat: add mermaid architecture diagrams, update to MMAI 891`

Replaced static PNG reference with 4 comprehensive mermaid diagrams in `README.md`. Updated all references from "MMAI 2026 Capstone" to "MMAI 891 Final Project" across all files.

### 2026-03-01 — Multilingual support (7 languages + RTL)

**Commit:** `feat: add multilingual support — 7 languages with RTL`

Added support for English, French, Chinese (Mandarin), Arabic, Spanish, Hindi, and Urdu. Frontend: language selector dropdown, translated UI strings, RTL layout for Arabic/Urdu. Backend: language-aware session management, Whisper language hints, multilingual welcome messages. Updated: `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/js/app.js`, `frontend/styles/main.css`, `backend/api_server.py`.

### 2026-03-01 — Deployment guide + tech stack rewrite

**Commit:** `feat: add deployment guide, rewrite tech stack with runtime architecture`
