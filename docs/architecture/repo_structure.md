# Repository Structure

**Authors:** Syed Ali Turab, Fergie Feng & Diana Liu | **Team:** Broadview | **Date:** March 1, 2026

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the repository layout for the PetCare Triage & Smart Booking Agent. The structure supports:

- Flask-based API server with in-process agent orchestration
- Modular sub-agent design (7 agents + orchestrator)
- Static frontend served by Flask
- Docker containerization (single container + n8n via docker-compose)
- Comprehensive documentation separated from implementation

## 3. Directory Responsibilities

### Root Level

Configuration, deployment, and top-level documentation files. These are the first files a new developer reads.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Project overview, mermaid architecture diagrams, quick start |
| `PROJECT_PLAN.md` | 6-phase development roadmap with owners, status, risks |
| `TECH_STACK.md` | Full technology stack with runtime architecture diagrams |
| `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` | Step-by-step guides for local, Docker, Render, Railway |
| `technical_report.md` | MMAI 891 assignment report template |
| `requirements.txt` | Python package dependencies |
| `Dockerfile` | Single-container Docker image definition |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Multi-container setup (petcare + n8n) |

### `backend/`

All server-side Python code. The Flask API server (`api_server.py`) is the single entry point. It serves the frontend as static files and exposes REST endpoints. The orchestrator coordinates agents. Agents are isolated Python modules with standardized I/O contracts.

### `backend/agents/`

Each file implements one sub-agent with a standardized interface:
- `process(input_data)` → returns structured output dict
- LLM-backed agents (A, D, G) call external APIs
- Rule-based agents (B, C, E, F) run locally with zero API cost

### `backend/data/`

Static JSON files that serve as the POC's data layer. In production, these would be replaced by database tables. See `docs/architecture/data_model.md` for field-level schemas.

### `frontend/`

Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no build step, no npm, no framework. Served directly by Flask. Includes multilingual support (7 languages), RTL layout, and 3-tier voice interaction.

### `docs/`

All documentation, organized by topic. Architecture docs describe the system design. Agent specs provide per-agent details and test fixtures (intake, safety_gate, triage, routing, scheduling, guidance_summary, orchestrator). The `original_main/` folder preserves the foundational docs from the main branch for reference.

## 4. Design Rationale

| Principle | How It's Applied |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Separation of concerns** | Backend logic, frontend UI, data, and documentation are in separate directories |
| **Agent modularity** | Each agent is a self-contained Python module with its own spec doc |
| **No build step** | Frontend is vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no webpack, no npm, no transpiling |
| **Data abstraction** | Agents read from JSON files via a consistent interface; swapping to a database changes only the data layer |
| **Voice as a layer** | Voice endpoints live in `api_server.py` but don't alter agent logic |
| **Docker-first** | The entire app runs in a single Docker container; n8n is a separate container via docker-compose |
| **Docs alongside code** | Documentation lives in `docs/` next to the source, not in a separate wiki |

## 5. Key Files for New Developers

If you're onboarding, read in this order:

1. `README.md` — what this project does
2. `TECH_STACK.md` — how it's built and deployed
3. `docs/architecture/system_overview.md` — architecture and workflow
4. `docs/architecture/agents.md` — sub-agent responsibilities and contracts
5. `docs/architecture/data_model.md` — data schemas and access policy
6. `docs/test_scenarios.md` — concrete test cases
7. `backend/api_server.py` — entry point for the backend
8. `backend/orchestrator.py` — how agents are coordinated
9. `PROJECT_PLAN.md` — what's done and what's next
