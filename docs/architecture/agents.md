## Agent Model

Agents are specialized sub-components that receive structured input, perform a focused task, and return structured output with evidence and confidence. The Orchestrator coordinates execution order, manages branching, and merges results.

## Sub-Agent Details

### Pre-Intake Content-Safety Guardrails (Two-Stage Pipeline)

- **Trigger:** Every user message, before any LLM call
- **Stage 1 — Regex fast-path** (`backend/guardrails.py`): ~0ms, zero API cost. Covers 8 categories: prompt injection / jailbreak (OWASP LLM01, LLM07), data extraction (OWASP LLM02), violence / weapons / terrorism / self-harm / animal cruelty, sexual / explicit / bestiality, human-as-pet, substance abuse (pet context), abuse / harassment / slurs, trolling / off-topic. Leet-speak normalization, multilingual patterns (FR, ES, ZH, AR, HI, UR), pet-medical context exemptions (e.g. "my dog ate rat poison" passes through). Also handles: deceased pet (compassionate close), non-pet subjects (redirect to human health), normal animal behavior.
- **Stage 2 — LLM semantic classifier** (`_llm_classify()` in `guardrails.py`): GPT-4o-mini screens messages that pass Stage 1 for semantic attacks — paraphrased jailbreaks, indirect prompt injection, and context-manipulation framing (e.g. "as a thought experiment with no rules..."). Enabled by default in production (`GUARDRAIL_LLM_ENABLED=true`). Adds ~300-500ms; fail-open (API errors never block legitimate users).
- **Audit trail:** Every Stage 2 call is traced in LangSmith as `guardrail.llm_classifier` with tag `llm_classifier` — filterable in the LangSmith dashboard for safety review and annotation.
- **Output:** Block with localized response, or pass to Intake Agent
- **Edge Cases:** Medical emergencies that superficially match violence/substance patterns; leet-speak obfuscation (s3x, p0rn, b0mb); novel semantic jailbreaks not in regex library (caught by Stage 2)
- **Test Suite:** 181 test cases covering all categories + multilingual + false-positive prevention

### A. Intake Agent

- **Trigger:** Owner initiates intake via chat
- **Logic:** Warm, conversational receptionist style (`temperature=0.3` for natural phrasing). Asks species and chief complaint first; fires `intake_complete=True` as soon as both are known — does **not** require timeline/eating/energy answers before completing. Accepts any date/duration format verbatim in `symptom_details.timeline` ("since Monday", "about a week", "since March 1st"). After `intake_complete`, `enrich_context()` generates ONE complaint-specific follow-up question (e.g. "when did the limping start?" for injury; "is she still keeping water down?" for vomiting) in the session language; capped at 2 turns. Anatomical plausibility validation (`_check_plausibility()`) flags impossible species/symptom combinations. All LLM calls use shared retry wrapper with exponential backoff.
- **New method:** `enrich_context(session)` — `@traceable(name="intake.enrich_context")`, GPT-4o-mini, max 80 tokens, temperature 0.4. Returns plain question string or None.
- **Output:** `pet_profile`, `chief_complaint`, `symptom_details`, `timeline`
- **Edge Cases:** Owner provides minimal info, conflicting symptoms, exotic species, relative date answers ("since last Tuesday")

### B. Safety Gate Agent

- **Trigger:** Intake data collected
- **Logic:** Rule-based matching against known emergency red flags (breathing difficulty, uncontrolled bleeding, suspected toxin ingestion, seizures, collapse, inability to urinate). **Temporal past-incident filter:** `_is_past_incident()` scans ±80-char window around each match for temporal past markers in all 7 languages (EN/FR/ES/ZH/AR/HI/UR) — skips the flag if found (e.g. "had a seizure last year" does not trigger escalation).
- **Output:** `red_flag_detected` (boolean), `red_flags[]`, `escalation_message`
- **Edge Cases:** Ambiguous descriptions ("breathing funny" vs "can't breathe")

### C. Confidence Gate Agent

- **Trigger:** After safety check (if no red flag)
- **Logic:** Check required fields present, assess confidence in symptom data, detect conflicting signals
- **Output:** `confidence_score` (0-1), `missing_fields[]`, `conflicts[]`, `action` (proceed / clarify / human_review)
- **Edge Cases:** Owner contradicts themselves, critical field missing

### D. Triage Agent

- **Trigger:** Confidence gate passes
- **Logic:** Classify urgency into 4 tiers based on symptoms, timeline, species, **breed, age, and weight** (from `pet_profile`). Age-based modifier: geriatric (>8yr dog, >10yr cat) or very young (<6 months) bumped one tier higher when borderline. **RAG grounding (v1.1):** Before the LLM call, `retrieve_illness_context()` scores the chief complaint against `pet_illness_kb.json` (24 entries, keyword-overlap scoring, species bonus +2, category bonus +1) and injects the top-3 results as a `=== CLINICAL REFERENCE ===` block into the system prompt. This provides the LLM with evidence-based urgency escalators, red flags, and species-specific notes from curated ASPCA/AVMA/Cornell sources — reducing hallucination and ensuring conservative triage decisions are grounded in clinical data. Provide rationale (no diagnosis names) and confidence score. Rule-based fallback (`_rule_based_triage`) used if LLM call fails; RAG context applies only to the primary LLM path.
- **New dependency (v1.1):** `backend/utils/rag_retriever.py` — keyword-overlap RAG retriever over `backend/data/pet_illness_kb.json`
- **Output:** `urgency_tier` (Emergency / Same-day / Soon / Routine), `rationale`, `confidence`, `contributing_factors[]`
- **Edge Cases:** Borderline urgency, multiple concurrent issues; TC-04 (male cat urinary blockage) now correctly classified Emergency via URIN-001 KB entry

### E. Routing Agent

- **Trigger:** Triage complete
- **Logic:** Map symptom category (GI, derm, respiratory, injury/pain, dental, wellness, behavioral) to appointment type and provider pool using clinic rule map.
- **Output:** `symptom_category`, `appointment_type`, `provider_pool[]`, `special_requirements`
- **Edge Cases:** Multi-category symptoms, species requiring specialist

### F. Scheduling Agent

- **Trigger:** Routing complete
- **Logic:** Based on urgency tier and appointment type, find matching available slots from the clinic schedule. **Slots are regenerated fresh on every request** (not cached at startup) so proposed dates are always relative to the current date. **Urgency date-window filtering** narrows the candidate pool before scoring: Same-day → today only, Soon → next 1–3 days, Routine → next 7 days. If the strict window yields no slots, the agent falls back to the full pool to guarantee a non-empty proposal. Propose top 2-3 options or generate a booking request payload.
- **Output:** `proposed_slots[]`, `booking_request` (JSON payload for clinic system)
- **Edge Cases:** No slots available for required urgency, after-hours emergency

### G. Guidance & Summary Agent

- **Trigger:** All prior agents complete
- **Logic:** Generate safe, non-diagnostic "do/don't while waiting" guidance for the owner. Produce a structured clinic-ready intake summary with all collected data.
- **Output:** `owner_guidance` (text), `clinic_summary` (structured JSON)
- **Edge Cases:** Emergency (guidance is "go to ER now"), very routine case

## Data Access Policy

Role-based data access enforces minimal privilege and prevents cross-responsibility leakage:

| Agent | `clinic_rules.json` | `red_flags.json` | `available_slots.json` | `pet_illness_kb.json` | Intake Records | Appointments |
|-------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **A -- Intake** | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **B -- Safety Gate** | -- | Read | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **C -- Confidence Gate** | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **D -- Triage** | -- | -- | -- | Read (via RAG retriever) | -- | -- |
| **E -- Routing** | Read | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **F -- Scheduling** | -- | -- | Read | -- | -- | Write |
| **G -- Guidance & Summary** | -- | -- | -- | -- | Write | -- |
| **Orchestrator** | Read | Read | Read | -- | Read/Write | Read |

### Responsibility Boundaries

**Triage Agent (D)**
- Cannot create or modify appointments
- Cannot access scheduling data
- Uses LLM (GPT-4o-mini) for urgency classification with rule-based signal-counting fallback

**Scheduling Agent (F)**
- Cannot alter triage results or urgency levels
- Cannot modify clinic rules
- Only agent that writes appointment records

**Safety Gate Agent (B)**
- Cannot override urgency levels set by Triage
- Only generates escalation signals based on curated red-flag list
- Does not provide guidance text (that's Agent G's job)

**Guidance & Summary Agent (G)**
- Cannot modify triage or routing decisions
- Generates guidance using approved non-diagnostic language
- Only agent that writes intake records

This boundary enforcement reduces risk of logic entanglement and clinical inconsistency. See `docs/architecture/data_model.md` for full schema details.

## Common Output Contract

Each sub-agent returns:

- `agent_name` (string)
- `status` (`success` | `escalate` | `needs_review`)
- `output` (agent-specific structured data)
- `confidence` (0-1)
- `warnings[]` (if degraded or uncertain)
- `processing_time_ms` (integer, tracked at Orchestrator level)

## Agent Quality Guidelines

- Never fabricate symptoms or medical details not provided by the owner
- Never provide a diagnosis or prescribe treatment
- Use conservative defaults when uncertain (escalate rather than under-triage)
- Keep guidance language safe and non-diagnostic
- All recommendations must be actionable and specific

## Why Multi-Agent Instead of a Single LLM Pipeline?

A single LLM prompt that takes raw owner input and produces triage + routing + scheduling + guidance in one pass is tempting but fragile. The multi-agent architecture provides:

| Advantage | How It Helps |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Responsibility isolation** | Each agent has one job. A bug in scheduling cannot corrupt triage logic. |
| **Auditability** | Every decision is traceable to a specific agent with its own input/output log. |
| **Independent testing** | Each agent can be unit-tested against its own fixtures without running the full pipeline. |
| **Reduced failure cascade** | If the Scheduling Agent fails (no slots), the Triage and Guidance outputs are unaffected. |
| **Modular extensibility** | Adding a new agent (e.g., Insurance Verification) means adding one file, not rewriting the prompt. |
| **Mixed execution modes** | Safety-critical agents (B, C) run as deterministic rules with zero cost; only reasoning-heavy agents (A, D, G) call the LLM. A single-prompt approach would force everything through the LLM. |
| **Cost control** | Rule-based agents (B, C, E, F) cost nothing per request. Only 3 of 7 agents make API calls. |
| **Reliability** | Shared `llm_call_with_retry()` wrapper (`backend/utils/llm_utils.py`) gives all LLM-calling agents automatic exponential-backoff retry on transient OpenAI errors. |

The architecture is designed as a **safety-constrained orchestration system** rather than a monolithic chatbot. The primary innovation lies in **structured triage enforcement and routing intelligence**, not conversational novelty.

## Design Decision: 7 Agents vs. 8 Agents (Category Agent Consolidation)

The original system design (see `docs/original_main/agent-design.md`) specified **8 sub-agents**, including a separate **Category Agent** responsible solely for classifying the symptom domain (GI, respiratory, skin, injury, behavioral, chronic).

In our implementation, we consolidated this into **7 agents** by folding symptom categorization into the **Routing Agent (E)**:

| Aspect | 8-Agent Design (original) | 7-Agent Design (current) |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Categorization** | Dedicated Category Agent | Handled inside Routing Agent (E) |
| **Flow** | Intake → Safety → Triage → **Category** → Routing → Scheduling → Guidance | Intake → Safety → Confidence → Triage → **Routing** (classifies + routes) → Scheduling → Guidance |
| **Confidence Gate** | Not present | **Added** as Agent C — validates field completeness before triage |
| **Safety Agent** | Combined detection + guidance | **Split** — Safety Gate (B) detects; Guidance (G) generates text |

### Why We Made This Change

1. **Categorization and routing are tightly coupled.** The category output is only consumed by the Routing Agent. Having a separate agent pass a category string to routing adds a hop without adding value for the POC.
2. **We added a Confidence Gate instead.** The original 8-agent design lacked an explicit validation step between intake and triage. Our Confidence Gate (C) catches incomplete data and triggers clarification loops — a more impactful use of an agent slot.
3. **Safety is better as detection-only.** Splitting the original Safety Agent into a rule-based detector (B) and an LLM-powered guidance generator (G) means red-flag detection is deterministic and zero-cost, while guidance quality benefits from LLM reasoning.
4. **Fewer agents = simpler POC.** For a POC, 7 agents with clear separation is easier to demo, test, and explain than 8.

If the system moves to production, the Category Agent could be reintroduced as a standalone classifier to enable independent accuracy measurement and domain-specific tuning.
