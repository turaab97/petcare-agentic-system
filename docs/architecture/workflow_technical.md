# Technical Workflow (Flowchart + I/O Contracts + Examples)

This is the technical workflow reference for engineers.

## 1) End-to-End Flow

1. Owner initiates intake via web chat.
2. **Intake Agent** collects pet profile, chief complaint, and symptom details through adaptive follow-up questions.
3. **Safety Gate** checks for emergency red flags (breathing difficulty, bleeding, toxin ingestion, seizures, collapse).
4. If red flag detected → emergency escalation response → END.
5. **Confidence Gate** validates required fields and assesses data confidence.
6. If low confidence → loop back to Intake for clarifying questions or route to receptionist.
7. **Triage Agent** assigns urgency tier (Emergency / Same-day / Soon / Routine) with rationale.
8. **Routing Agent** classifies symptom category and maps to appointment type / provider pool.
9. **Scheduling Agent** proposes available slots or generates booking request.
10. **Guidance & Summary Agent** produces owner "do/don't" guidance + clinic-ready structured summary.
11. Orchestrator assembles and returns the final response.

## 2) Agent-by-Agent Execution

### Step 1: Intake (Required)

**Agent:** Intake Agent (A)

- Collect: species, breed, age, weight, chief complaint, symptom timeline
- Ask adaptive follow-ups based on symptom area
- Output: structured pet profile + symptom data (JSON)

### Step 2: Safety Gate (Required)

**Agent:** Safety Gate Agent (B)

- Check symptoms against emergency red-flag list
- Output: `red_flag_detected` boolean, `escalation_message` if true

### Step 3: Confidence Gate (Required)

**Agent:** Confidence Gate Agent (C)

- Validate required fields, detect conflicts, assess confidence
- Output: confidence score, missing fields, recommended action

### Step 4: Triage (Required)

**Agent:** Triage Agent (D)

- Classify urgency tier with evidence and confidence
- Output: urgency tier, rationale, confidence score

### Step 5: Routing (Required)

**Agent:** Routing Agent (E)

- Map symptom category to appointment type and provider pool
- Output: symptom category, appointment type, provider list

### Step 6: Scheduling (Required for MVP)

**Agent:** Scheduling Agent (F)

- Propose slots based on urgency and appointment type
- Output: proposed slots array or booking request payload

### Step 7: Guidance & Summary (Required)

**Agent:** Guidance & Summary Agent (G)

- Generate safe owner guidance and clinic-ready summary
- Output: owner guidance text + clinic summary JSON

## 4) Input Contract

### Required Input (from owner)

## 6) Notes

- Emergency red flags bypass all agents after Safety Gate and produce an immediate escalation response.
- The Confidence Gate can loop back to Intake up to 2 times before routing to receptionist review.
- All agents must complete within the 15-second latency target (measured end-to-end).
- For canonical field definitions, see `docs/architecture/output_schema.md`.
