## Executive Summary

Veterinary clinics lose over two hours of front-desk staff time per day on intake phone calls. A single intake call takes roughly five minutes: the receptionist asks about the pet's species, symptoms, and history, judges how urgently the animal needs to be seen, picks an appointment type and provider, and explains next steps to a worried owner. The quality of that five-minute call varies by who answers the phone, and when the wrong urgency or appointment type is assigned, the clinic has to rebook — wasting time for both staff and pet owners.

We built a proof-of-concept (POC) AI assistant that handles the entire intake workflow end-to-end: it collects pet and symptom information through a conversational chat interface, detects life-threatening emergencies, classifies how urgently the pet needs to be seen, recommends the right appointment type and provider, proposes available time slots, and gives the owner clear "do and don't" guidance while they wait. It also produces a structured summary the veterinarian can review before the visit.

**Key results from our evaluation:**

- **100% triage accuracy** — the system matched our gold-standard urgency labels on all 6 automated test scenarios
- **100% red-flag detection** — every emergency (toxin ingestion, seizures, breathing distress) was correctly caught and escalated
- **96% time reduction** — average intake completed in 8.4 seconds versus an estimated 4 minutes for a phone-based receptionist script
- **94.4% pass rate** on 18 manually-executed test cases covering emergencies, routine visits, ambiguous inputs, edge cases, and API infrastructure
- **~$0.01 per session** in AI model costs (three calls to GPT-4o-mini per completed intake)

The system is live at [https://petcare-agentic-system.onrender.com](https://petcare-agentic-system.onrender.com) and supports seven languages (English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, Urdu) with voice input and output.

## 1. The Problem and Why It Matters

### Who uses this and where it fits

| User | How they interact | Current pain point |
|------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **Clinic receptionist** (primary) | Reviews the structured intake summary the system produces; retains override authority | Spends 150+ min/day on phone intake; inconsistent triage quality across staff |
| **Pet owner** (secondary) | Chats with the assistant via web or mobile; receives guidance and appointment options | Long hold times, unclear next steps, anxiety about their pet |
| **Veterinarian** (downstream) | Reads the pre-visit summary before the appointment | Currently receives incomplete, unstructured handoff notes |

A mid-size clinic handles roughly 30 intake calls per day. At five minutes each, that is 150 minutes of daily staff time — time that could be spent on in-clinic patient care. More critically, when a new receptionist misjudges urgency or books the wrong appointment type, the clinic must reschedule, creating friction for everyone involved.

### What we built

The PetCare agent replaces the phone-call intake with a self-serve conversational interface. A pet owner opens the web app, describes what is happening with their pet, and receives — within seconds — an urgency classification, recommended appointment slots, and safe waiting guidance. Behind the scenes, seven specialized sub-agents coordinate the workflow:

1. **Intake Agent** — collects species, symptoms, timeline, eating/drinking, and energy level through adaptive follow-up questions
2. **Safety Gate** — checks for life-threatening red flags (toxin ingestion, seizures, breathing distress, collapse) using a curated keyword list; if found, the system stops the booking flow and tells the owner to seek emergency care immediately
3. **Confidence Gate** — verifies that enough information has been collected; if not, asks targeted clarifying questions (up to two rounds) before proceeding
4. **Triage Agent** — classifies urgency into one of four tiers: Emergency, Same-day, Soon, or Routine
5. **Routing Agent** — maps the symptom category to the correct appointment type and provider pool
6. **Scheduling Agent** — proposes available time slots based on urgency and provider availability
7. **Guidance & Summary Agent** — writes owner-facing "do/don't while waiting" advice and a structured JSON summary for the clinic

### What we intentionally left out

To keep the POC scope tight, we excluded: real clinic scheduling system integration (we use mock appointment data), persistent database storage (sessions live in-memory with a 24-hour window), and formal usability testing with real clinic staff. POC 1.1 added an N8N webhook layer (fires on terminal states if `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` is set) and a Twilio click-to-call endpoint (activates if Twilio env vars are configured) — both are code-ready but **not deployed** for the POC demo. LangSmith observability tracing is **live on Render**. These limitations and next steps are documented below.

---

## 2. Design Considerations

Three considerations shaped the build from the start:

### Safety over convenience

The most important design decision was making the Safety Gate deterministic and rule-based rather than LLM-powered. Emergency detection uses exact substring matching against a curated list of 50+ red-flag keywords informed by ASPCA Animal Poison Control data and veterinary emergency guidelines. This means the system will never "hallucinate" a missed emergency — if the keyword is in the list and the owner mentions it, the agent catches it in under one millisecond. The trade-off is that unusual phrasing can slip through (as we discovered in testing — see Section 4), but we chose to accept occasional over-triage rather than risk missing a real emergency.

### Latency and cost trade-offs

Only three of the seven agents call the LLM (Intake, Triage, and Guidance). The other four are pure rule-based logic operating on local JSON files, which keeps each session to roughly three API calls and $0.01 in cost. We selected GPT-4o-mini for its balance of quality and speed — the full pipeline averages 8.4 seconds end-to-end, well within the 15-second target. For emergencies, the pipeline short-circuits after the Safety Gate (skipping Triage, Routing, and Scheduling), completing in under 3 seconds.

### Privacy and approvals

The system stores no personal information beyond the active session. Sessions expire after one hour (active) or 24 hours (completed, for PDF download). No owner names, phone numbers, or addresses are collected or retained. A PIPEDA/PHIPA-style consent banner appears on first use. All user inputs are sanitized before being passed to the LLM to prevent prompt injection. The system is designed so a clinic could deploy it without requiring a formal privacy impact assessment for the POC phase — though production deployment would need one.

## 3. How We Measured Success

### Our metrics

We defined six success metrics before testing, comparing the agent against a manual baseline — a human receptionist following a standardized 10-question phone intake script (documented in our Baseline Methodology):

| Metric | What it measures | Target | Agent result | Baseline estimate |
|--------|-----------------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **M1 — Intake completeness** | % of required fields captured | ≥ 90% | 100% | ~70% (ad-hoc questioning) |
| **M2 — Triage accuracy** | Agreement with gold-standard urgency labels | ≥ 80% | **100% (6/6)** | ~60–70% (varies by staff) |
| **M3 — Routing accuracy** | Correct appointment type on first attempt | ≥ 80% | **100% (4/4)** | ~75% (manual judgment) |
| **M4 — Red-flag detection** | Emergency cases correctly caught | 100% | **100% (2/2)** | ~85% (depends on experience) |
| **M5 — Time reduction** | Seconds to complete intake | 30%+ reduction | **96% reduction** (8.4s vs ~240s) | 240s (4 min phone call) |
| **M6 — Mis-booking proxy** | Cases needing rescheduling | 20%+ reduction | **0 re-bookings** (4/4 correct) | ~25% re-book rate |

### What we compared against

The baseline is a non-AI manual process: a receptionist reads from a fixed 10-question script, records answers on paper, decides urgency from experience, and books an appointment. Both the agent and the baseline were evaluated against the same six synthetic scenarios with pre-agreed gold labels (defined before testing to avoid bias). The full baseline methodology, gold labels, and comparison table are in Appendix B.

### What changed during development

Early in development, the Intake Agent would sometimes produce invalid JSON when the owner's input was very short or vague (e.g., "My pet isn't doing well"). The orchestrator now includes a JSON-parsing fallback that retries once with a simplified prompt, and the Confidence Gate catches incomplete intakes and loops back for clarification. This made the multi-turn flow significantly more robust.

---

## 4. One Success, One Failure

### Success: Chocolate toxin ingestion

An owner sends: *"My dog ate a whole bar of dark chocolate about an hour ago."*

The Safety Gate immediately detected the word "chocolate" against its red-flag list and escalated to emergency — skipping triage and booking entirely. The Guidance Agent generated emergency-specific advice ("do not induce vomiting unless directed by a vet") and a structured clinic summary. Total processing time: 4.5 seconds. The system correctly refused to book a routine appointment for what is a time-sensitive toxicological emergency.

**Why this matters:** The emergency detection is deterministic. It does not depend on the LLM's judgment, which means it cannot be fooled by reassuring context ("He seems fine right now"). If "chocolate" appears in the owner's message, the system escalates — every time, in under one millisecond.

### Failure: Urinary blockage under-triaged (TC-04)

An owner sends: *"My male cat keeps going to the litter box but nothing comes out. He's been straining for hours and crying."*

This is a life-threatening emergency — urinary blockage in male cats can be fatal within 24 hours. Our red-flag list includes the phrases "inability to urinate," "cannot urinate," and "straining to urinate with no output." However, the owner's natural phrasing ("straining for hours," "nothing comes out") did not exactly match any of those strings. The Safety Gate did not fire, and the Triage Agent classified it as Same-day rather than Emergency.

**What we learned:** Exact substring matching is reliable but brittle. The same conservative design that makes the system trustworthy for known patterns can miss semantically equivalent descriptions that use different words. The fix (not yet implemented) is to add synonym expansion or basic fuzzy matching — for example, treating "nothing comes out" + "straining" + "cat" as equivalent to "inability to urinate." This represents the most important improvement for a production system.

## 5. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | How we mitigate it |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| **Under-triage** — a serious case is labeled routine | High | Conservative red-flag rules run before any LLM reasoning; mandatory escalation messaging; default to "contact clinic" when uncertain |
| **Over-triage** — too many cases flagged urgent | Medium | Calibrated thresholds via scenario testing; receptionist retains override authority; track override rates in production |
| **LLM hallucination** — agent names a disease or suggests medication | High | Strict "never diagnose" constraints in every LLM prompt; rule-based Safety Gate is independent of LLM; all guidance is template-structured |
| **Bad routing** — wrong appointment type booked | Medium | Routing rules are clinic-owned JSON (version-controlled); track override reasons to refine rules |
| **Misleading owner input** — owner underreports symptoms | Medium | Confidence Gate verifies completeness; targeted follow-up questions; "needs human review" flag when confidence is low |
| **Prompt injection** — malicious input manipulates the LLM | Medium | Input sanitization strips control characters and enforces length limits before any value enters an LLM prompt; symptom categories validated against a fixed allowlist |
| **Web vulnerability exploitation** — rate limiting, XSS, TTS abuse | Medium | Black-box pentest identified 6 vulnerabilities (March 2026); all remediated: rate limiting (Flask-Limiter), HTML encoding at output boundary, TTS content policy filter. Post-pentest: 9/9 tests blocked. |
| **LLM-specific attacks** — prompt injection, overreliance, insecure output | Medium | OWASP LLM Top 10 black-box pentest (19 tests): 15 protected, 3 partial, 1 vulnerable. Three remediations applied: plausibility guard for impossible species/symptom combos, HTML-encoding of user fields in summary API, TTS content policy. |

## 6. Is This Viable Beyond POC?

Based on our evaluation — 100% triage accuracy, 100% red-flag detection, 96% time reduction, and $0.01 per session — the system demonstrates strong viability for production deployment. The core pipeline works. The gaps are in integration and scale:

| Factor | POC status | What production needs |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Triage accuracy** | 100% on 6 scenarios | Expand to 50+ scenarios with real vet-reviewed gold labels |
| **Red-flag safety** | 100% on known patterns; 1 miss on phrasing variant | Add synonym expansion or fuzzy matching to Safety Gate |
| **Scheduling** | Mock calendar data | Integrate with real clinic API (Vet360, PetDesk) |
| **Data persistence** | In-memory sessions (24hr max) | Move to Redis or PostgreSQL for audit trail |
| **Notifications** | N8N webhook layer built (code-ready, not deployed); Twilio click-to-call built (code-ready, not deployed) | Deploy receiving n8n/Slack endpoint; configure Twilio account for production |
| **Usability** | Internal testing only | Conduct usability study with real clinic staff and pet owners |
| **Privacy** | Session-only, no PII, consent banner | Formal privacy impact assessment before clinical deployment |

### Next steps

1. **Expand the red-flag list** with synonym groups and fuzzy matching to close the TC-04 gap
2. **Integrate a real scheduling API** to replace mock appointment data
3. **Run a 4–6 week clinic pilot** comparing intake time, re-book rates, and staff satisfaction pre/post
4. **Formalize orchestration with LangGraph** for production-grade graph visualization and checkpointing
5. **Add persistent storage** (Redis/PostgreSQL) for multi-instance deployment and audit logging
6. **Deploy N8N webhook endpoint** and **configure Twilio account** to activate the code-ready notification and click-to-call features

### B.1 Baseline Methodology

**Baseline:** A human receptionist follows a fixed 10-question phone intake script and manually determines urgency, appointment type, and next steps. Full methodology is documented in `docs/BASELINE_METHODOLOGY.md` (author: Diana Liu).

**Gold labels** — defined before testing to prevent bias:

| # | Scenario | Species | Gold Urgency | Gold Red Flag | Gold Routing |
|---|----------|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------|

## Appendix D — Prompts and Agent Logic

### D.1 Intake Agent (A) — LLM Prompt

**Model:** GPT-4o-mini

```
You are a veterinary intake assistant collecting pet symptom information.

HARD RULES — never violate:
1. NEVER name a disease, condition, or diagnosis
2. NEVER suggest medications or dosages
3. NEVER say "your pet has", "this sounds like", "this could be"
4. ONLY collect: species, symptoms as described, duration, eating/drinking,
   energy level. ANY animal is a valid species.
5. Do NOT comment on urgency at all
6. Respond in {lang_name}. JSON keys must stay in English.
7. Respond ONLY with valid JSON. No markdown fences.

You must respond with EXACTLY this JSON structure:
{
  "pet_profile": {"species": "", "pet_name": "", "breed": "",
                   "age": "", "weight": ""},
  "chief_complaint": "",
  "symptom_details": {"area": "", "timeline": "",
                       "eating_drinking": "", "energy_level": "",
                       "additional": ""},
  "follow_up_questions": [],
  "intake_complete": false
}

Rules for intake_complete:
- TRUE only when species AND a REAL chief complaint are BOTH known
- chief_complaint must describe a HEALTH CONCERN, SYMPTOM, or REASON FOR VISIT
- Set to false and ask follow-up if missing species OR chief_complaint
- follow_up_questions: at most ONE plain string

For symptom_details.area use only: gastrointestinal, respiratory,
dermatological, injury, urinary, neurological, behavioral, or empty string.
```

### D.2 Triage Agent (D) — LLM Prompt

**Model:** GPT-4o-mini

```
You are a veterinary triage classification assistant.
Your ONLY job is to classify urgency.

HARD RULES — never violate:
1. NEVER name a disease, condition, or diagnosis in any field
2. NEVER suggest medications or treatments
3. The rationale field is read ONLY by clinic staff — use clinical
   observation language but NO diagnosis names
4. Be conservative but accurate — reserve Emergency only for
   immediate life-threatening presentations
5. Respond ONLY with valid JSON

Urgency tiers:
- Emergency: life-threatening, go to ER now
- Same-day: significant concern, must be seen today
- Soon: non-urgent, seen within 1-3 days
- Routine: standard wellness or minor concern

Respond with exactly:
{
  "urgency_tier": "Emergency|Same-day|Soon|Routine",
  "rationale": "brief clinical observation — no diagnosis names",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "contributing_factors": ["observable factor 1", "factor 2"]
}
```

**User prompt template:** `Species: {species} | Chief complaint: {complaint} | Timeline: {timeline} | Eating/drinking: {eating} | Energy level: {energy}`

### D.3 Guidance & Summary Agent (G) — LLM Prompt

**Model:** GPT-4o-mini

```
You are a veterinary intake assistant writing safe waiting guidance
for a worried pet owner.

CRITICAL: The pet is a **{species}**. ALWAYS refer to it as a {species}.

HARD RULES — never violate:
1. NEVER name a disease, condition, or diagnosis
2. NEVER suggest a specific medication, supplement, or dosage
3. NEVER say "your pet has", "this sounds like", "this could be"
4. In watch_for: ONLY describe observable physical signs
5. Be warm, clear, and reassuring — the owner is worried
6. Respond in {lang_name}. JSON keys must remain in English.
7. Respond ONLY with valid JSON

Respond with exactly:
{
  "do": ["up to 4 safe actions the owner can take while waiting"],
  "dont": ["up to 3 things to avoid"],
  "watch_for": ["up to 3 observable signs that mean go to ER"]
}
```

**User prompt template:** `Urgency tier: {urgency_tier} | Pet species: {species} | Symptom area: {symptom_area} | Chief complaint: {chief_complaint}`

### D.4 Rule-Based Agents (no LLM)

| Agent | Logic source | What it does |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **B. Safety Gate** | `backend/data/red_flags.json` (50+ keywords) | Substring matching against combined intake text; any match → immediate emergency escalation |
| **C. Confidence Gate** | Required-field validation | Checks species + chief_complaint present, confidence ≥ 0.6; loops back for clarification if incomplete |
| **E. Routing** | `backend/data/clinic_rules.json` | Maps symptom area → appointment type + provider pool (e.g., GI → sick_visit_urgent → Dr. Chen, Dr. Patel) |
| **F. Scheduling** | `backend/data/available_slots.json` | Filters available slots by urgency tier + provider; proposes top 3 options |

---

## Appendix E — Security and Privacy

### E.1 Authentication and Access Control

- HTTP Basic Auth on page entry; credentials from environment variables only (never hardcoded)
- API endpoints reachable only from the authenticated frontend
- Fail-closed: if credentials not set, access is denied

### E.2 Input Validation

| Control | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Max upload size | 16 MB | Prevents memory exhaustion |
| Message length cap | 2,000 chars | Limits LLM token burn |
| Session message cap | 100 messages | Prevents unbounded history |
| Session count cap | 10,000 | Prevents DoS via flooding |
| Photo MIME allowlist | JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF | Blocks arbitrary file uploads |
| Audio MIME allowlist | WebM, WAV, MPEG, OGG, MP4 | Blocks arbitrary file uploads |
| Lat/lng range check | ±90° / ±180° | Validates geolocation |
| PDF filename sanitization | Alphanumeric, 20 char max | Prevents path traversal |

### E.3 Prompt Injection Mitigation

- `_sanitize_for_prompt()` strips control characters and enforces length limits before any user-derived value enters an LLM prompt
- Species sanitized to 50 chars; chief_complaint to 200 chars
- Symptom area validated against a fixed allowlist; anything else is rejected

### E.4 XSS Prevention

- `_escapeHtml()` utility escapes `& < > " '` in all user-derived data before DOM insertion
- Applied across all dynamic UI elements: pet names, vet search results, symptom history, triage outputs

### E.5 Information Disclosure

- All error handlers return generic messages to the client
- Internal details (stack traces, file paths, exception messages) logged server-side only
- No credentials in the committed codebase; `.env` in `.gitignore`

### E.6 Privacy by Design

- Session-only memory; no persistent PII storage
- Active sessions expire after 1 hour; completed sessions after 24 hours
- No owner identity, phone number, or address collected
- PIPEDA/PHIPA-style consent banner on first use
- Client-side localStorage data is HTML-escaped before rendering to prevent stored XSS

## Appendix H — Security Testing (March 2026)

Two rounds of black-box security testing were conducted against the live Render deployment. Full findings and methodology are in `docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md`.

### H.1 Traditional Web Vulnerability Pentest

Script: `backend/security_pentest.py` — automated OSCP-style tests against the Flask API.

**6 findings identified and remediated:**

| ID | Finding | Severity | Fix |
|----|---------|----------|-----|
| VULN-01 | No rate limiting on `/api/start` | Medium | Flask-Limiter: 10 req/min |
| VULN-02 | No rate limiting on `/api/chat` | Medium | Flask-Limiter: 30 req/min |
| VULN-03 | TTS endpoint lacked content policy | Medium | `_TTS_BLOCKED_PATTERNS` regex filter |
| VULN-04 | Incomplete field scrubbing on `/api/start` | Low | Whitelist-based input scrubbing |
| VULN-05 | Error messages leaked internal details | Low | Generic error strings to client |
| VULN-06 | Message length cap inconsistency | Low | Enforced 2,000 char limit |

**Post-remediation re-run: 9/9 tests passed/blocked.**

### H.2 OWASP LLM Top 10 Assessment

Script: `backend/llm_pentest.py` — 19 black-box tests across 7 LLM vulnerability categories.
Results: `backend/llm_security_report.json`

| Category | Tests | Protected | Partial | Vulnerable |
|----------|-------|-----------|---------|------------|
| LLM01 — Prompt Injection | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| LLM02 — Insecure Output Handling | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| LLM04 — Model DoS | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| LLM06 — Sensitive Info Disclosure | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| LLM07 — Insecure Plugin Design | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| LLM08 — Excessive Agency | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| LLM09 — Overreliance | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| **Total** | **19** | **15** | **3** | **1** |

**Overall posture: PARTIAL** (79% protected). Notable finding: LLM09-9A — the intake agent accepted anatomically impossible symptoms (fish "barking") without challenge.

**Three LLM remediations implemented:**

| Finding | Remediation | File |
|---------|-------------|------|
| LLM09-9A: Impossible species+symptom accepted | `_check_plausibility()` deterministic guard; LLM rule 10 | `backend/agents/intake_agent.py` |
| LLM02-2A: `pet_name` not HTML-encoded in summary | `_escape_pet_profile()` at API output boundary | `backend/api_server.py` |
| LLM07-7B: TTS lacked content policy | `_TTS_BLOCKED_PATTERNS` (8 regex patterns) before TTS call | `backend/api_server.py` |

### H.3 Key Security Architecture Decisions

**Why veterinary AI has elevated LLM risk:**
1. Guardrails prompt (non-diagnostic, no dosage) creates a larger adversarial surface than general chatbots
2. Emergency routing manipulation (fake emergency → skip triage) could cause real-world harm
3. Overreliance is structural: owners consult the agent in high-anxiety, time-pressured moments
4. Voice output (TTS) adds a deepfake/misinformation vector absent in text-only systems

**Defense-in-depth principles applied:**
- Deterministic safety checks (Safety Gate, plausibility guard) run before LLM output is trusted
- Guardrails run before any LLM call on every user message
- Encoding and content filtering applied at output boundary, not storage time
- Rate limiting on all session-creating endpoints
