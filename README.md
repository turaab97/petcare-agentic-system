# 🐾 PetCare Agentic System

**Authors:** Syed Ali Turab, Fergie Feng & Diana Liu | **Team:** Broadview
**Date:** March 1, 2026

AI-powered Veterinary Triage & Smart Booking System
A safety-first, multi-agent architecture designed to assist veterinary clinics with structured symptom intake, urgency triage, intelligent routing, and appointment booking — built as part of the MMAI 891 Final Project at Queen's University.

---

## 🚀 Overview

PetCare Agentic System is an AI receptionist framework built to reduce call overload in veterinary clinics by:

- Collecting structured symptom information via chat or voice (7 languages)
- Safely triaging urgency levels with deterministic red-flag detection
- Routing cases to the correct service line or veterinarian
- Booking appointments intelligently from clinic schedule
- Generating clinic-ready structured summaries (JSON)
- Providing conservative waiting guidance to pet owners
- Triggering post-intake automations via n8n (email, Slack, Sheets)

The system is designed with **layered responsibility separation**, **safety constraints**, and **extensibility** in mind.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Veterinary clinics often face:

- **High call volumes** — front desk overwhelmed during peak hours
- **Incomplete symptom descriptions** — owners omit critical details
- **Mis-booked appointments** — wrong provider, wrong urgency, wrong slot
- **Repeated clarification calls** — staff calling back to collect missing info
- **Inconsistent triage** — urgency varies by who answers the phone

This system addresses those issues through structured AI-assisted intake and routing with a multi-agent architecture.

## 🤖 Core Multi-Agent Layer

The PetCare Agent uses a **7-sub-agent architecture** coordinated by a central **Orchestrator Agent**:

| # | Agent | Type | Responsibility |
|---|-------|------|---------------|
| A | **Intake Agent** | 🔴 LLM | Collect pet profile + chief complaint + timeline; ask adaptive follow-ups by symptom area |
| B | **Safety Gate Agent** | 🟢 Rules | Detect emergency red flags → immediate escalation messaging |
| C | **Confidence Gate Agent** | 🟢 Rules | Verify required fields and confidence; route to clarification or receptionist review |
| D | **Triage Agent** | 🔴 LLM | Assign urgency tier (Emergency / Same-day / Soon / Routine) with rationale + confidence |
| E | **Routing Agent** | 🟢 Rules | Classify symptom category → appointment type / provider pool |
| F | **Scheduling Agent** | 🟢 Rules | Propose available slots or generate booking request payload |
| G | **Guidance & Summary Agent** | 🔴 LLM | Generate owner "do/don't" guidance + structured clinic-ready intake summary |

Only 3 of 7 agents make LLM API calls (~$0.01/session). The other 4 run locally as deterministic rules with zero cost.

Agents operate under role-based data permissions to maintain safety boundaries. See [docs/architecture/agents.md](docs/architecture/agents.md) for full I/O contracts and data access policy.

---

## 🗄 Data Layer

| Data Store | Purpose | Used By |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `backend/data/clinic_rules.json` | Triage rules, routing maps, provider specialties | Triage (D), Routing (E) |
| `backend/data/red_flags.json` | 50+ emergency trigger phrases | Safety Gate (B) |
| `backend/data/available_slots.json` | Mock clinic schedule (30-min slots) | Scheduling (F) |
| In-memory session | Active intake records, appointments | All agents via Orchestrator |

See [docs/architecture/data_model.md](docs/architecture/data_model.md) for full schemas.

## 🛡 Safety-First Design Principles

> Core innovation lies in safety-grounded triage and structured routing — not just conversational AI.

This system is **not merely a chatbot**. It is a safety-constrained, rule-grounded, modular multi-agent orchestration framework.

- **No medical diagnosis generation** — never provides diagnoses or prescriptions
- **Deterministic safety layer** — red-flag detection runs as rules before any AI reasoning
- **Rule-grounded urgency classification** — triage maps to clinic-approved rules
- **Red-flag symptom escalation** — 50+ curated emergency triggers with mandatory escalation
- **Structured confirmation** — critical fields verified by Confidence Gate before triage
- **Separation between triage and booking** — urgency classification isolated from scheduling
- **Minimal PII storage** — session-only memory, no persistent owner data
- **Conservative defaults** — when uncertain, escalate rather than under-triage

---

## 🎤 Voice Support

Three tiers of voice interaction for hands-free intake (ideal for pet owners holding a distressed pet):

| Tier | Technology | Cost | Latency | Feel |
|------|-----------|------|---------|------|
| **Tier 1** | Browser Web Speech API | Free | ~100ms | Walkie-talkie |
| **Tier 2** | OpenAI Whisper + TTS | ~$0.02/session | ~1-2s | Walkie-talkie |
| **Tier 3** | OpenAI Realtime API | ~$0.50/session | <500ms | Natural phone call |

Voice is an **opt-in I/O wrapper** — it does NOT alter business logic or agent decisions.

Voice mode requires:
- Critical symptom confirmation via voice
- Noise-handling fallback (text if low confidence)
- Red-flag double confirmation before escalation

See [TECH_STACK.md](TECH_STACK.md) for full voice safety requirements and testing metrics.

---

## 🌐 Multilingual Support

The system supports **7 languages** with full UI translation, RTL support, and multilingual voice:

| Language | Flag | Direction | Voice (STT/TTS) |
|----------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| English | 🇬🇧 | LTR | Full |
| French | 🇫🇷 | LTR | Full |
| Chinese (Mandarin) | 🇨🇳 | LTR | Full |
| Arabic | 🇸🇦 | **RTL** | Full |
| Spanish | 🇪🇸 | LTR | Full |
| Hindi | 🇮🇳 | LTR | Full |
| Urdu | 🇵🇰 | **RTL** | Full |

- Arabic and Urdu automatically flip the layout to right-to-left (RTL)
- Clinic-facing summaries are always generated in English
- Language can be changed mid-conversation
- Set language via URL parameter: `?lang=fr`

---

## 🏷 Technology Stack

| 2 | Unblock Intake so pipeline can complete (set `intake_complete: True` when species + chief complaint present — rule or LLM) | ⬜ |
| 3 | Smoke test: run backend locally, send one message end-to-end, confirm triage + guidance response | ⬜ |
| 4 | Validate Scenario 1 (emergency) and Scenario 3 (toxin) — Safety Gate + emergency path | ⬜ |
| 5 | Validate Scenario 2 (routine skin) and Scenario 4 (ambiguous → clarify) — full pipeline + confidence gate | ⬜ |
| 6 | Add language to Intake/Triage/Guidance prompts; verify voice (Tier 1/2) | ⬜ |
| 7 | Deploy to **Render** (recommended); add env vars, confirm live URL | ⬜ |
| 8 | Optional: n8n webhooks (Emergency Alert + Clinic Summary) | ⬜ |
| 9 | Evaluation: 20+ scenarios, metrics; document 1 strong + 1 failure case | ⬜ |
| 10 | Report + 10–15 min demo video; final README polish | ⬜ |

**After team testing:** Report writing and demo recording — record the demo from the **Render** deployment (live URL), not localhost, so the video shows the deployed app. Complete `technical_report.md` and add the Render URL to the README Live Demo section.

## 📌 Design Philosophy

> Core innovation lies in safety-grounded triage and structured routing — not just conversational AI.

The system is built to be:

- **Modular** — agents can be extended or replaced independently
- **Extensible** — voice, telephony, and new agents added without altering triage core
- **Safety-aligned** — deterministic safety layer + conservative defaults
- **Clinically practical** — structured outputs for real clinic workflows

## Data Sources

The PetCare agent draws triage knowledge, symptom data, and red-flag rules from the following sources:

### Symptom & Triage Knowledge

| Source | Type | Usage |
|--------|------|-------|
| [Hugging Face: pet-health-symptoms-dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/karenwky/pet-health-symptoms-dataset) | Open dataset (2,000 labeled samples) | Symptom classification training/validation -- covers skin irritations, digestive issues, parasites, ear infections, mobility problems |
| [Vet-AI Symptom Checker](https://www.vet-ai.com/symptomchecker) | Reference | Triage logic patterns -- 165 algorithms built by veterinarians, 4M+ questions processed |
| [SAVSNET / PetBERT](https://github.com/SAVSNET/PetBERT) | NLP model (500M+ words from 5.1M UK vet records) | Reference for veterinary NLP and disease coding patterns |

### Safety & Toxicology

| Source | Type | Usage |
|--------|------|-------|
| [ASPCA Animal Poison Control (AnTox)](https://www.aspcapro.org/antox) | Reference database (1M+ cases) | Red-flag rules for toxin ingestion -- top toxins, species-specific risks |
| [ASPCA Top Toxins 2024](https://www.aspcapro.org/resource/top-10-toxins-2024) | Published list | Prioritized toxin list for Safety Gate agent (OTC meds 16.5%, food/drink 16.1%, chocolate 13.6%, etc.) |
| Veterinary emergency textbooks | Clinical reference | Emergency red-flag definitions (GDV, urinary blockage, dyspnea, seizure, etc.) |

### Clinic Operations (Synthetic / Mock)

| Source | Type | Usage |
|--------|------|-------|
| `backend/data/clinic_rules.json` | Synthetic config | Triage rules, routing maps, provider specialties, species notes |
| `backend/data/red_flags.json` | Curated list (50+ entries) | Emergency red-flag triggers compiled from ASPCA + veterinary emergency guidelines |
| `backend/data/available_slots.json` | Mock data | Simulated clinic schedule for appointment booking POC |

### Data Strategy

- **POC phase:** All data is synthetic or publicly available. No real patient/pet health information (PHI) is used.
- **Future integration:** Clinic scheduling APIs, EMR/CRM systems, real-time appointment availability.
- **Privacy:** Session-only memory. No persistent storage of owner PII. Anonymized logs for evaluation only.
