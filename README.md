AI-powered Veterinary Triage & Smart Booking System
A safety-first, multi-agent architecture designed to assist veterinary clinics with structured symptom intake, urgency triage, intelligent routing, and appointment booking — built as part of the MMAI 891 Final Project at Queen's University.

**For pet owners:** Structured intake and clear next steps. **For clinics:** Triage support and structured handoffs — no diagnosis, no bypassing the doctor.

---

## 🚀 Overview

PetCare Agentic System is an AI receptionist framework built to reduce call overload in veterinary clinics by:

- **MVP: text-first** — Structured symptom intake via **chat (text)**; voice is optional/bonus and not required for demo or baseline evaluation (see [BASELINE_METHODOLOGY](docs/BASELINE_METHODOLOGY.md)).
- Collecting structured symptom information via chat (or voice when enabled; 7 languages)
- Safely triaging urgency levels with deterministic red-flag detection
- Routing cases to the correct service line or veterinarian
- Booking appointments intelligently from clinic schedule
- Generating clinic-ready structured summaries (JSON)
- Providing conservative waiting guidance to pet owners
- Triggering post-intake automations via webhook (email, Slack, etc.)
- **Finding nearby veterinary clinics** via Google Maps integration (with calling and directions)
- **Exporting triage summaries as PDF** for sharing with your vet (professional clinic-ready format)
- **Analyzing symptom photos** via OpenAI Vision API (visual symptom observation)
- **Remembering pet profiles** across sessions (localStorage persistence)
- **Tracking symptom history** for returning users
- **Streaming responses** for a dynamic, ChatGPT-like experience
- **Cost estimator** showing estimated visit costs post-triage
- **Feedback rating** system for quality measurement
- **Follow-up reminders** via browser notifications
- **Breed-specific risk alerts** for known health conditions
- **Dark mode** toggle for accessibility
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** support for mobile installation
- **Chat transcript export** for sharing full conversations
- **Animated onboarding** walkthrough for first-time users
- **Warm, professional PetCare UI** with teal theme and branded design

The system is designed with **layered responsibility separation**, **safety constraints**, and **extensibility** in mind.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Veterinary clinics often face:

- **High call volumes** — front desk overwhelmed during peak hours
- **Incomplete symptom descriptions** — owners omit critical details
- **Mis-booked appointments** — wrong provider, wrong urgency, wrong slot
- **Repeated clarification calls** — staff calling back to collect missing info
- **Inconsistent triage** — urgency varies by who answers the phone

This system addresses those issues through structured AI-assisted intake and routing with a multi-agent architecture.

## 👥 Who It's For (Two Products, One System)

PetCare serves **two audiences** with **one pipeline**: pet owners get a clear intake experience and guidance; clinics get structured triage and handoffs so staff can act quickly. Think of it as two products in how we position value — owners and clinics — powered by the same backend.

### For pet owners

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Product** | Structured symptom intake & triage |
| **What you get** | Describe your pet's issue in chat (text or optional voice) → get a **suggested** "how soon to be seen" (Emergency / Same-day / Soon / Routine), **contextual "do/don't while waiting" guidance** (tailored to symptom type from templates; we don't name diseases), and optional **appointment slot options** — without long hold times or repeating yourself. The **final** decision on when to be seen is the **clinic's** (receptionist or doctor); we only suggest based on intake. The system does **not** name conditions or diseases. The AI adds value by **structured intake**, **adaptive follow-ups**, **symptom-dependent suggested triage**, and **symptom-type-specific guidance**. |
| **Safety** | **Not diagnosis.** We never say *what is wrong*. We only suggest *when* to be seen and give general waiting-room advice; the **clinic (receptionist/doctor) makes the real call**. No prescription. When in doubt, we tell you to **seek care** or **talk to the clinic**. Red flags trigger immediate escalation messaging. |

### For clinics

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Product** | Intake & triage support for front desk and clinical staff |
| **What you get** | **Fewer incomplete calls**, **consistent intake**, and **structured JSON summaries** with a **suggested** urgency tier and routing so reception and vets can act quickly. The system **suggests** Emergency / Same-day / Soon / Routine for routing; the **receptionist and doctor make the final decision** — receptionist still involves the doctor when needed, same as today. Red-flag detection and handoff to staff when the system isn't confident. |
| **Safety** | The AI **supports** intake and suggests triage; **medical and scheduling decisions stay with receptionists, nurses, and doctors**. The system never diagnoses, prescribes, or bypasses the doctor. Receptionist asks the doctor when in doubt; we don't replace that. Low-confidence or conflicting info routes to human receptionist review. |

One system, two value propositions: better experience for owners, better workflow for clinics.

**Two outputs, one pipeline:**

| Audience | Interface | Output |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Pet owner** | One chat interface (web) | Conversational response: suggested urgency, "do/don't while waiting" guidance, optional slot options. |
| **Clinic** | No separate UI for POC | Structured JSON summary delivered via **webhook** (configurable for email, Slack, etc.). |

So: one owner-facing chat with its output; one clinic-facing JSON (same intake) sent through the clinic's chosen channel (email, Slack, webhook).

**Override and verification (required for clinics):**

- **Staff/doctor override:** The clinic must be able to **override** the system's suggested urgency (and routing/slot if needed). If the AI suggests Emergency but staff or the doctor disagrees, they can change it to Same-day / Soon / Routine — and vice versa. The system suggests; staff/doctor decide.
- **Verified before sending to individuals:** The suggested triage and any booking must be **verified** (and optionally overridden) by staff or the doctor **before** the final response or confirmation is sent to the pet owner. So: system produces suggestion + JSON → clinic sees it → staff/doctor verify or override → **then** the owner gets the final message or booking confirmation. No automatic send to the owner without clinic verification in the intended workflow.
- **Emergency = additional charge:** Booking as **Emergency** often incurs an **additional charge**. Override prevents inappropriate emergency labeling (and unnecessary cost to the owner or incorrect resource use). Staff/doctor verify before confirming an emergency appointment.

**How this would be built (with override and verification in place):**

| Phase | What gets built | Owner experience | Clinic experience |
|-------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **POC (current)** | One pipeline: owner chat → 7 agents → owner gets **suggested** response in chat; clinic gets JSON via webhook. Deployed on **Render**. | Sends message → sees suggested urgency + guidance + slots in chat immediately. | Receives JSON summary (suggested tier, routing, summary). Override/verify is **manual** (e.g. staff reads JSON in Slack/email and contacts owner if they disagree). |
| **Production (intended)** | Same pipeline + **clinic verification step** before owner sees final message. | Sends message → may see “We’re reviewing your case” → **after** staff/doctor verify (and optionally override) → owner gets final message or booking confirmation. | Receives JSON in Slack/email → staff/doctor **review, override urgency if needed** (e.g. change Emergency → Same-day) → **approve** → system (or staff) sends final response to owner. Emergency tier clearly flagged (additional charge). |

**Build order:**

1. **Now (POC):** Wire Orchestrator to API → unblock Intake → smoke test → validate scenarios → deploy (e.g. Render). Owner chat shows suggestion; clinic gets JSON. Document that production requires “verify before send” and override.
2. **Clinic side for POC:** Ensure JSON includes `suggested_urgency_tier` (and optionally `is_emergency` for billing). Send to Slack/email so staff can at least see and act manually (call owner, override in their own system).
3. **Later (production):** Add a **verification step**: e.g. a **clinic queue/dashboard** — cases appear in a simple queue, staff override urgency and click “Approve & send to owner,” API updates session and notifies owner. Either way: **no final message to owner until clinic has verified (or overridden) and approved.**

So: build the pipeline and two outputs first (owner chat + clinic JSON); then add the step where clinic verifies/overrides before the owner gets the final say.

## 🤖 Core Multi-Agent Layer

The PetCare Agent uses a **7-sub-agent architecture** coordinated by a central **Orchestrator Agent**. All agents run **in-process** within the same Flask server (no microservices, no network calls between agents):

| # | Agent | Type | Input | Output | Responsibility |
|---|-------|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| A | **Intake Agent** | 🔴 LLM | User message + conversation history | Pet profile, chief complaint, follow-up question | Collect species, breed, age, weight, chief complaint, timeline; ask adaptive follow-ups by symptom area (GI, respiratory, derm, injury, urinary, neuro, behavioral). Supports any animal species (dogs, cats, birds, reptiles, fish, horses, exotic). |
| B | **Safety Gate Agent** | 🟢 Rules | Extracted symptoms from Intake | Red-flag status, matched keywords | Scan for 50+ emergency trigger phrases from `red_flags.json` (difficulty breathing, seizures, collapse, suspected toxin, inability to urinate, uncontrolled bleeding). Triggers immediate escalation — bypasses triage/routing/booking. |
| C | **Confidence Gate Agent** | 🟢 Rules | Pet profile fields, symptom data | Proceed / clarify / human-review decision | Verify required fields (species, chief complaint, duration) are present and consistent. If missing → loop back to Intake (max 2x). If conflicting → route to human receptionist review. |
| D | **Triage Agent** | 🔴 LLM | Complete pet profile + symptoms | Urgency tier, confidence score, rationale | Assign urgency: **Emergency** (life-threatening, within hours), **Same-day** (needs attention today), **Soon** (within 1-3 days), **Routine** (next available). Returns rationale and 0-1 confidence score. |
| E | **Routing Agent** | 🟢 Rules | Symptom category from Triage | Appointment type, provider pool | Map symptom category to appointment type and provider pool using `clinic_rules.json`. Species-specific routing (cat vs dog vs exotic → different providers). |
| F | **Scheduling Agent** | 🟢 Rules | Appointment type, urgency tier | Proposed time slots | Query `available_slots.json` for slots matching urgency window. Emergency → earliest available; Routine → next regular slot. |
| G | **Guidance & Summary** | 🔴 LLM | Full session data (all agent outputs) | Owner guidance + clinic JSON | Generate species-correct "do/don't while waiting" + escalation cues (owner-facing, in session language). Generate structured clinic-ready JSON summary (always English). |

**Execution model:** Sequential within a single HTTP request. Only 3 of 7 agents make LLM API calls (~$0.01/session). The other 4 run locally as deterministic rules with zero cost and zero latency.

**Data permissions:** Agents operate under role-based data access. Triage cannot modify the pet profile. Safety Gate runs before Triage to prevent any downstream reasoning on emergency cases. Scheduling cannot override triage urgency. See [docs/architecture/agents.md](docs/architecture/agents.md) for full I/O contracts and data access policy.

## 🗄 Data Layer

| Data Store | Purpose | Used By |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `backend/data/clinic_rules.json` | Triage rules, routing maps, provider specialties | Triage (D), Routing (E) |
| `backend/data/red_flags.json` | 50+ emergency trigger phrases | Safety Gate (B) |
| `backend/data/available_slots.json` | Mock clinic schedule (30-min slots) | Scheduling (F) |
| In-memory session | Active intake records, appointments | All agents via Orchestrator |

See [docs/architecture/data_model.md](docs/architecture/data_model.md) for full schemas.

## 🛡 Safety-First Design Principles

> Core innovation lies in safety-grounded triage and structured routing — not just conversational AI.

This system is **not merely a chatbot**. It is a safety-constrained, rule-grounded, modular multi-agent orchestration framework.

- **No medical diagnosis generation** — never provides diagnoses or prescriptions
- **Deterministic safety layer** — red-flag detection runs as rules before any AI reasoning
- **Rule-grounded urgency classification** — triage maps to clinic-approved rules
- **Red-flag symptom escalation** — 50+ curated emergency triggers with mandatory escalation
- **Structured confirmation** — critical fields verified by Confidence Gate before triage
- **Separation between triage and booking** — urgency classification isolated from scheduling
- **Minimal PII storage** — session-only memory, no persistent owner data
- **Conservative defaults** — when uncertain, escalate rather than under-triage

---

## 🎤 Voice Support

Three tiers of voice interaction for hands-free intake (ideal for pet owners holding a distressed pet):

| Tier | Technology | Cost | Latency | Feel |
|------|-----------|------|---------|------|
| **Tier 1** | Browser Web Speech API | Free | ~100ms | Walkie-talkie |
| **Tier 2** | OpenAI Whisper + TTS | ~$0.02/session | ~1-2s | Walkie-talkie |
| **Tier 3** | OpenAI Realtime API | ~$0.50/session | <500ms | Natural phone call |

Voice is an **opt-in I/O wrapper** — it does NOT alter business logic or agent decisions.

Voice mode requires:
- Critical symptom confirmation via voice
- Noise-handling fallback (text if low confidence)
- Red-flag double confirmation before escalation

See [TECH_STACK.md](TECH_STACK.md) for full voice safety requirements and testing metrics.

---

## 🌐 Multilingual Support

The system supports **7 languages** with full UI translation, RTL support, and multilingual voice:

| Language | Flag | Direction | Voice (STT/TTS) |
|----------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| English | 🇬🇧 | LTR | Full |
| French | 🇫🇷 | LTR | Full |
| Chinese (Mandarin) | 🇨🇳 | LTR | Full |
| Arabic | 🇸🇦 | **RTL** | Full |
| Spanish | 🇪🇸 | LTR | Full |
| Hindi | 🇮🇳 | LTR | Full |
| Urdu | 🇵🇰 | **RTL** | Full |

- Arabic and Urdu automatically flip the layout to right-to-left (RTL)
- Clinic-facing summaries are always generated in English
- Language can be changed mid-conversation
- Set language via URL parameter: `?lang=fr`

## 📊 Data Sources

### Operational data (used at runtime)

The POC uses only these data files. All are synthetic; no real patient/pet health information (PHI) is used.

| Source | Type | Used by |
|--------|------|---------|
| `backend/data/clinic_rules.json` | Synthetic config | Routing (E): triage rules, routing maps, provider list |
| `backend/data/red_flags.json` | Curated list (50+ entries) | Safety Gate (B): emergency triggers |
| `backend/data/available_slots.json` | Mock data | Scheduling (F): appointment booking POC |

### Design references (not used at runtime)

The following were consulted for domain context and workflow design only. They are **not** loaded or called by the system.

| Source | Type | How we used it |
|--------|------|----------------|
| [HuggingFace: pet-health-symptoms-dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/karenwky/pet-health-symptoms-dataset) | Open dataset (2,000 samples) | Symptom taxonomy / category ideas |
| [Vet-AI Symptom Checker](https://www.vet-ai.com/symptomchecker) | Commercial product | Triage workflow design inspiration |
| [SAVSNET / PetBERT](https://github.com/SAVSNET/PetBERT) | Veterinary NLP reference | General NLP / coding patterns |
| [ASPCA Animal Poison Control](https://www.aspcapro.org/antox) | 1M+ cases | Ideas for red-flag phrasing in `red_flags.json` |
| Veterinary emergency textbooks | Clinical reference | Emergency red-flag definitions (curated into `red_flags.json`) |

## 📈 Success Metrics (MVP)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Triage tier agreement with clinic staff | ≥ 80% |
| Routing accuracy (correct appointment type) | ≥ 80% |
| Intake completeness (required fields captured) | ≥ 90% |
| Receptionist intake time reduction | 30%+ |
| Re-booking / mis-booking reduction | 20%+ |
| Red flag detection rate | 100% |

---

## 📌 Design Philosophy

> Core innovation lies in safety-grounded triage and structured routing — not just conversational AI.

The system is built to be:

- **Modular** — agents can be extended or replaced independently
- **Extensible** — voice, telephony, and new agents added without altering triage core
- **Safety-aligned** — deterministic safety layer + conservative defaults
- **Clinically practical** — structured outputs for real clinic workflows

## 🤝 Contribution

This project is structured for modular expansion. Contributions should preserve:

- Safety boundaries
- Agent responsibility isolation
- Rule-grounded triage design

---

## Data Sources (detailed)

See the [Data Sources](#-data-sources) section above for the main breakdown. Summary:

- **Operational (used at runtime):** `backend/data/clinic_rules.json`, `red_flags.json`, `available_slots.json` only. All synthetic; no PHI.
- **Design references (not used at runtime):** HuggingFace pet-health-symptoms-dataset, Vet-AI Symptom Checker, SAVSNET/PetBERT, ASPCA, veterinary textbooks — consulted for domain context and for curating the operational files above.

**Deployment:** POC uses **Render** for cloud deployment. Webhook/n8n is **optional** (only fires if `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` is set).

---

## Current Status

> **v1.0-poc — tested and passing.** See the [Current Status](#-current-status) section above for full details.

---

## Summary

This project demonstrates how a **multi-agent architecture with a central orchestrator** can deliver structured, safe, and explainable decision support for veterinary intake triage and appointment booking, while maintaining clear scope and academic rigor.

Built with safety-first agent architecture by **Team Broadview**.
